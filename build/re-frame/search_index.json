Pretty good.\n-- Terry Pratchett, The Fifth Elephant \n    reflecting on identity, flow and derived values\n\n\n\n\nre-frame\nre-frame is a pattern for writing SPAs in ClojureScript, using Reagent.\nMcCoy might report \"It's MVC, Jim, but not as we know it\".  And you would respond \n\"McCoy, you trouble maker, why even mention an OO pattern? \nre-frame is a functional framework.\"\nBeing a functional framework, it is about data, and the functions \nwhich transform that data.\nWhy Should You Care?\nPerhaps:\n\nYou want to develop an SPA in ClojureScript, and you are looking for a framework.\nYou believe Facebook did something magnificent when it created React, and\nyou are curious about the further implications. Is the combination of\nreactive programming, functional programming and immutable data going to\ncompletely change everything?  And, if so, what would that look like in a language\nthat embraces those paradigms?\nYou're taking a Functional Design and Programming course at San Diego State University\nand you have a re-frame/reagent assignment due.  You've left the reading a bit late, right?\nYou know Redux, Elm, Cycle.js or Pux and you're\ninterested in a ClojureScript implementation.\nIn this space, re-frame is very old, hopefully in a Gandalf kind of way.\nFirst designed in Dec 2014, it even slightly pre-dates the official Elm Architecture,\nalthough thankfully we were influenced by early-Elm concepts like foldp and lift, as well as \nClojure projects like Pedestal App, Om and Hoplon. Since then,\nre-frame has pioneered ideas like event handler middleware,\ncoeffect accretion, and de-duplicated signal graphs.\nWhich brings us to the most important point: re-frame is impressively buzzword compliant. It has reactivity,\nunidirectional data flow, pristinely pure functions,\ninterceptors, coeffects, conveyor belts, statechart-friendliness (FSM)\nand claims an immaculate hammock conception. It also has a charming\nxkcd reference (soon) and a hilarious, insiders-joke T-shirt,\nideal for conferences (in design).  What could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt Leverages Data\nYou might already know that ClojureScript is a modern lisp, and that\nlisps are homoiconic.  If not, you do now.\nThat homoiconic bit is significant. It means you program in a lisp by creating and\nassembling lisp data structures. Dwell on that for a moment. You are programming in data. \nThe functions which later transform data, themselves start as data.\nClojure programmers place particular \nemphasis on the primacy of data. When they aren't re-watching Rich Hickey videos, \nand wishing their hair was darker and more curly, \nthey meditate on aphorisms like Data is the ultimate in late binding.\nI cannot stress enough what a big deal this is. It may seem \nlike a syntax curiosity at first but, when the penny drops for \nyou on this, it tends to be a profound moment. And once you \nunderstand the importance of this concept at the language level, \nyou naturally want to leverage similar power at the library level.\nSo, it will come as no surprise, then, to know that re-frame has a \ndata oriented design. Events are data. Effects are data. DOM is data.\nThe functions which transform data are registered and looked up via \ndata. Interceptors (data) are preferred over middleware (higher \norder functions). Etc.\nData - that's the way we roll.\nIt is a loop\nArchitecturally, re-frame implements \"a perpetual loop\".\nTo build an app, you hang pure functions on certain parts of this loop, \nand re-frame looks after the conveyance of data \naround the loop, into and out of the transforming functions you \nprovide - hence a tag line of \"Derived Values, Flowing\".\nIt does Physics\nRemember this diagram from school? The water cycle, right?\n\nTwo distinct stages, involving water in different phases, being acted upon\nby different forces: gravity working one way, evaporation/convection the other.\nTo understand re-frame, imagine data flowing around that loop instead of water.\nre-frame\nprovides the conveyance of the data around the loop - the equivalent of gravity, evaporation and convection.\nYou design what's flowing and then you hang functions off the loop at\nvarious points to compute the data's phase changes.\nSure, right now, you're thinking \"lazy sod - make a proper Computer Science-y diagram\". But, no.\nJoe Armstrong says \"don't break the laws of physics\" - I'm sure\nyou've seen the videos - and if he says to do something, you do it\n(unless Rich Hickey disagrees, and says to do something else). So,\nthis diagram, apart from being a plausible analogy which might help\nyou to understand re-frame, is practically proof it does physics.\nIt is a 6-domino cascade\n\nComputationally, each iteration of the loop involves a\nsix domino cascade.\nOne domino triggers the next, which triggers the next, et cetera, boom, boom, boom, until we are \nback at the beginning of the loop, and the dominoes spring to attention \nagain, ready for the next iteration of the same cascade.\nThe six dominoes are: \n\nEvent dispatch\nEvent handling \nEffect handling \nQuery\nView\nDOM\n\n1st Domino - Event Dispatch\nAn event is sent when something happens - the user \nclicks a button, or a websocket receives a new message.\nWithout the impulse of a triggering event, no six domino cascade occurs.\nIt is only because of events that a re-frame app is propelled,\nloop iteration after loop iteration, from one state to the next.\nre-frame is event driven.\n2nd Domino - Event Handling\nIn response to an event, an application must decide what action to take. \nThis is known as event handling.\nEvent handler functions compute side effects (known in re-frame simply as effects). \nMore accurately, they compute \na description of effects. This description is a data structure \nwhich says, declaratively, how the world should change (because of the event).\nMuch of the time, only the \"application state\" of the SPA itself need\nchange, but sometimes the outside world must also be affected\n(localstore, cookies, databases, emails, logs, etc).\n3rd Domino - Effect Handling\nThe descriptions of effects are realised (actioned).\nNow, to a functional programmer, effects are scary in a \nxenomorph kind of way.\nNothing messes with functional purity\nquite like the need for side effects. On the other hand, effects are \nmarvelous because they move the app forward. Without them, \nan app stays stuck in one state forever, never achieving anything.\nSo re-frame embraces the protagonist nature of effects - the entire, unruly zoo of them - but\nit does so in a controlled and largely hidden way, and in a manner which is debuggable, auditable, mockable and pluggable.\nWe're Now At A Pivot Point\nDomino 3 just changed the world and, very often, one particular part of it: the application state.\nre-frame's app state is held in one place - think of it like you \nwould an in-memory, central database for the app (details later).\nAny changes to app state trigger the next part of the cascade \ninvolving dominoes 4-5-6.\nThere's a Formula For It\nThe 4-5-6 domino cascade implements the formula made famous by Facebook's ground-breaking React library:  v = f(s)\nA view, v, is a function, f, of the app state, s.\nSaid another way, there are functions f that compute which DOM nodes, v,\nshould be displayed to the user when the application is in a given app state, s.\nOr, to capture the dynamics we'd say: over time, as s changes, f\nwill be re-run each time to compute new v, forever keeping v up to date with the current s.\nOr, with yet another emphasis: over time what is presented to the user changes in response to application state changes. \nIn our case, domino 3 changes s, the application state,\nand, in response, dominoes 4-5-6 are concerned with re-running f to compute the new v \nshown to the user.\nExcept, of course, there are nuances.  For instance, there's no single f to run.\nThere may be many functions which collectively build the overall DOM, \nand only part of s may change at any one time, so only part of the \nv (DOM) need be re-computed and updated. And some parts of v might not \nbe showing right now.\nDomino 4 - Query\n\nDomino 4 is about extracting data from \"app state\", and providing it \nin the right format for view functions (which are Domino 5).\nDomino 4 is a novel and efficient de-duplicated signal graph which \nruns query functions on the app state, s, efficiently computing \nreactive, multi-layered, \"materialised views\" of s.\n(Relax about any unfamiliar terminology, you'll soon \nsee how simple the code actually is)\nDomino 5 - View\nDomino 5 is one or more view functions (aka Reagent components) that compute the \nUI DOM that should be displayed to the user.\nTo render the right UI, they need to source application state, which is\ndelivered reactively via the queries of Domino 4. They \ncompute hiccup-formatted data, which is a description of the DOM required.\nDomino 6 - DOM\nYou don't write Domino 6 - it is handled for you \nby Reagent/React. I mention it here \nfor completeness and to fully close the loop.\nThis is the step in which the hiccup-formatted \n\"descriptions of required DOM\", returned by the view functions of Domino 5, are made real.\nThe browser DOM nodes are mutated. \nManaging mutation\nThe two sub-cascades 1-2-3 and 4-5-6 have a similar structure.\nIn each, it is the second to last domino which \ncomputes \"data descriptions\" of mutations required, and it is \nthe last domino which does the dirty work and realises these descriptions.\nIn both cases, you don't need to worry yourself about this dirty work. re-frame looks \nafter those dominoes.\nA Cascade Of Simple Functions\nYou'll (mostly) be writing pure functions which \ncan be described, understood and \ntested independently. They take data, transform it and return new data.\nThe loop itself is mechanical and predictable in operation.\nSo, there's a regularity to how a re-frame app goes about its business,\nwhich leads, in turn, to an ease in reasoning and debugging.\nThe Dominoes Again - With Code Fragments\n\nSo that was the view of re-frame from 60,000 feet. We'll now shift down to 30,000 feet \nand look again at each domino, but this time with code fragments.\nImagine: we're working on a SPA which displays a list of items. You have \njust clicked the \"delete\" button next to the 3rd item in the list.\nIn response, what happens within this imaginary re-frame app? Here's a sketch \nof the six domino cascade:\n\nDon't expect \nto completely grok the terse code presented below. We're still at 30,000 feet. Details later. \n\nCode For Domino 1\nThe delete button for that 3rd item will be rendered by a ViewFunction which looks like this: \n(defn delete-button \n  [item-id]\n  [:div.garbage-bin \n     :on-click #(re-frame.core/dispatch [:delete-item item-id])])\n\nThat on-click handler uses re-frame's dispatch to emit an event.\nA re-frame event is a vector and, in this case, \nit has 2 elements: [:delete-item 2486] (where 2486 is the made-up id for that 3rd item).  \nThe first element of an event vector,\n:delete-item, is the kind of event. The rest is optional, useful data about the \nevent.  \nEvents express intent in a domain specific way. \nThey are the language of your re-frame system. \nCode For Domino 2\nAn event handler (function), called say h, is called to \ncompute the effect of the event [:delete-item 2486].\nOn app startup, re-frame.core/reg-event-fx would have been used to \nregister this h as the handler for  :delete-item events, like this:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-fx   ;; a part of the re-frame API\n  :delete-item                ;; the kind of event\n  h)                         ;; the handler function for this kind of event\n\nh is written to take two arguments: \n\na coeffects map which contains the current state of the world (including app state)\nthe event to handle\n\nIt is the job of h to compute how the world should be changed by the event, and \nit returns a map of effects - a description of those changes.\nHere's a sketch (we are at 30,000 feet):\n(defn h                               ;; choose a better name like delete-item\n [coeffects event]                    ;; args:  db from coeffect, event\n (let [item-id (second event)         ;; extract id from event vector\n       db      (:db coeffects)]       ;; extract the current application state\n   {:db  (dissoc-in db [:items item-id])})) ;; effect is change app state\n\nre-frame has ways (described in later tutorials) to inject necessary aspects\nof the world into that first coeffects argument (map). Different \nevent handlers need different \"things\" to get their job done. But \ncurrent \"application state\" is one aspect of the world which is \ninvariably needed, and it is available by default in the :db key.\nBTW, here is a more idiomatic rewrite of h which uses \"destructuring\" of the args: \n(defn h \n [{:keys [db]} [_ item-id]]    ;; \nCode For Domino 3\nAn effect handler (function) actions the effects returned by h.\nHere's what h returned:\n{:db  (dissoc-in db [:items 2486])}   ;; db is a map of some structure\n\nEach key of the map identifies one kind \nof effect, and the value for that key supplies further details. \nThe map returned by h only has one key, so there's only one effect.\nA key of :db means to update the app state with the key's value.\nThis update of \"app state\" is a mutative step, facilitated by re-frame\nwhich has a built-in effects handler for the :db effect.\nWhy the name :db?  Well, re-frame sees \"app state\" as something of an in-memory \ndatabase. More on this in a following tutorial.\nJust to be clear, if h had returned: \n{:wear  {:pants \"velour flares\"  :belt false}\n :tweet \"Okay, yes, I am Satoshi. #coverblown\"}\n\nThen, the two effects handlers registered for :wear and :tweet would \nbe called to action those two effects. And, no, re-frame \ndoes not supply standard effect handlers for either, so you would have had \nto have written them yourself (see how in a later tutorial).\nCode For Domino 4\nWe now start the v = f(s) part of the flow. \nThe application state\ns has just changed (via Domino 3) and now boom, boom go Dominoes 4, 5, \nand 6, at the end of which we have a new view, v, being shown to the user.\nIn this domino 4, a query (function) over this app state is automatically \ncalled.  This query function \"extracts\" data from application state, and \nthen computes \"a materialised view\" of the application state - producing\ndata which is useful to the view functions of domino, 5.\nNow, in this particular case, the query function is pretty trivial.\nBecause the items are stored in app state, there's not a lot \nto compute and, instead, it acts strictly like an extractor or accessor,\njust plucking the list of items out of application state:\n(defn query-fn\n  [db v]         ;; db is current app state, v the query vector\n  (:items db))   ;; not much of a materialised view\n\nOn program startup, such a query-fn must be associated with a query-id, \n(so it can be used via subscribe in domino 5) using re-frame.core/reg-sub, \nlike this:\n(re-frame.core/reg-sub  ;; part of the re-frame API\n   :query-items         ;; query id  \n   query-fn)            ;; query fn\n\nWhich says \"if, in domino 5, you see a (subscribe [:query-items]), then \nuse query-fn to compute it\".\nCode For Domino 5\nBecause the query function for :query-items just re-computed a new value, \nany view (function) which uses a (subscribe [:query-items]) \nis called automatically (reactively) to re-compute new DOM.\nView functions compute a data structure, in hiccup format, describing \nthe DOM nodes required. In this \"items\" case, the view functions will not be generating \nhiccup for the just-deleted item obviously but, other than this, \nthe hiccup computed \"this time\" will be the same as \"last time\".\n(defn items-view\n  []\n  (let [items  (subscribe [:query-items])]  ;; source items from app state\n    [:div (map item-render @items)]))   ;; assume item-render already written\n\nNotice how items is \"sourced\" from \"app state\" via re-frame.core/subscribe.\nIt is called with a vector argument, and the first element of that vector is\na query-id which identifies the \"materialised view\" required by the view.\nNote: subscribe queries can be parameterised. So, in real world apps\nyou might have this:\n  (subscribe [:items \"blue\"])\nThe vector identifies, first, the query, and then\nsupplies further arguments. You could think of that as \nrepresenting select * from Items where colour=\"blue\".\nExcept there's no SQL available and you would be the one to implement\nthe more sophisticated query-fn capable of handling the \n\"where\" argument. More in later tutorials.\nCode For Domino 6\nThe hiccup returned by the view function \nis made into real browser DOM by Reagent/React. No code from you required. Just happens.\nThe DOM computed \"this\ntime\" will be the same as \"last time\", except for the absence of DOM for the\ndeleted item, so the mutation will be to remove those now-missing\nDOM nodes from the browser.\n3-4-5-6 Summary\nThe key point to understand about our 3-4-5-6 example is:\n\na change to app state ...\ntriggers query functions to rerun ...\nwhich triggers view functions to rerun\nwhich causes modified browser DOM \n\nBoom, boom, boom go the dominoes. It is a reactive data flow.\nAaaaand we're done\nAt this point, the re-frame app returns to a quiescent state, \nwaiting for the next event.\nSo, your job is ...\nWhen building a re-frame app, you:\n\ndesign your app's information model (data and schema layer)\nwrite and register event handler functions  (control and transition layer)  (domino 2)\n(once in a blue moon) write and register effect and coeffect handler\nfunctions (domino 3) which do the mutative dirty work of which we dare not\nspeak. \nwrite and register query functions which implement nodes in a signal graph (query layer) (domino 4)\nwrite Reagent view functions  (view layer)  (domino 5)\n\nre-frame is mature and proven in the large\nre-frame was released in early 2015, and has since \nbeen successfully\nused by\nquite a \nfew companies and\nindividuals to build complex apps, many running beyond 40K lines of\nClojureScript.\n\nScale changes everything. Frameworks\nare just pesky overhead at small scale - measure them instead by how they help\nyou tame the complexity of bigger apps, and in this regard re-frame has\nworked out well. Some have been effusive in their praise.\nHaving said that, re-frame remains a work in progress and it falls\nshort in a couple of ways - for example it doesn't work as well as we'd\nlike with devcards, because it is a framework, rather than a library. \nWe're still puzzling over some aspects and tweaking as we go. All designs\nrepresent a point in the possible design space, with pros and cons.\nAnd, yes, re-frame is fast, straight out of the box. And, yes, it has \na good testing story (unit and behavioural). And, yes, it works with figwheel to create\na powerful hot-loading development story. And, yes, it has \nfun specialist tooling, and a community,\nand useful 3rd party libraries.\nWhere Do I Go Next?\nAt this point, you know 50% of re-frame.

All the crap that had to happen to put it there however...— Fogus (@fogus) April 11, 2014\n\n\nThe Big Ratom\nre-frame puts all your application state into one place, which is\ncalled app-db.\nIdeally, you will provide a spec for this data-in-the-one-place,\nusing a powerful and leverageable schema.\nNow, this advice is not the slightest bit controversial for 'real' databases, right?\nYou'd happily put all your well-formed data into PostgreSQL.\nBut within a running application (in memory), there can be hesitation. If you have\na background in OO, this data-in-one-place\nbusiness is a really, really hard one to swallow.  You've\nspent your life breaking systems into pieces, organised around behaviour and trying\nto hide state.  I still wake up in a sweat some nights thinking about all\nthat Clojure data lying around exposed and passive.\nBut, as Fogus reminds us, data at rest is quite perfect.\nIn re-frame, app-db is one of these:\n(def app-db  (reagent/atom {}))    ;; a Reagent atom, containing a map\n\nAlthough it is a Reagent atom (hereafter ratom), I'd encourage\nyou to think of it as an in-memory database. It will contain structured data.\nYou will need to query that data. You will perform CRUD\nand other transformations on it. You'll often want to transact on this\ndatabase atomically, etc.  So \"in-memory database\"\nseems a more useful paradigm than plain old map-in-atom.\nFurther Notes:\n\napp-state would probably be a more accurate name, but I choose app-db instead because\n I wanted to convey the in-memory database notion as strongly as possible.\nIn the documentation and code, I make a distinction between app-db (the ratom) and\ndb which is the (map) value currently stored inside this ratom. Be aware of that naming as you read code.\nre-frame creates and manages an app-db for you, so\nyou don't need to declare one yourself (see the the first FAQ if you want\nto inspect the value it holds).\napp-db doesn't actually have to be a ratom containing a map.  It could, for example,\nbe a datascript database.  In fact, any database which\ncan signal you when it changes would do. We'd love! to be using datascript database - so damn cool -\nbut we had too much data in our apps. If you were to use it, you'd have to tweak re-frame a bit and use Posh.\n\nThe Benefits Of Data-In-The-One-Place\n\nHere's the big one:  because there is a single source of truth, we write no\ncode to synchronise state between many different stateful components.  I\ncannot stress enough how significant this is. You end up writing less code\nand an entire class of bugs is eliminated.\n(This mindset is very different to OO which involves\ndistributing state across objects, and then ensuring that state is synchronised, all the while\ntrying to hide it, which is, when you think about it, quite crazy ... and I did it for years).\n\nBecause all app state is coalesced into one atom, it can be updated\nwith a single reset!, which acts like a transactional commit. There is\nan instant in which the app goes from one state to the next, never a series\nof incremental steps which can leave the app in a temporarily inconsistent, intermediate state.\nAgain, this simplicity causes a certain class of bugs or design problems to evaporate.\n\nThe data in app-db can be given a strong schema\nso that, at any moment, we can validate all the data in the application. All of it!\nWe do this check after every single \"event handler\" runs (event handlers compute new state).\nAnd this enables us to catch errors early (and accurately). It increases confidence in the way\nthat Types can increase confidence, only a good schema can potentially provide more\nleverage than types.\n\nUndo/Redo becomes straight forward to implement.\nIt is easy to snapshot and restore one central value. Immutable data structures have a\nfeature called structural sharing which means it doesn't cost much RAM to keep the last, say, 200snapshots. All very efficient.\nFor certain categories of applications (eg: drawing applications) this feature is borderline magic.\nInstead of undo/redo being hard, disruptive and error prone, it becomes trivial.\nBut, many web applications are not self contained\ndata-wise and, instead, are dominated by data sourced from an authoritative, remote database.\nFor these applications, re-frame's app-db is mostly a local caching\npoint, and being able to do undo/redo its state is meaningless because the authoritative\nsource of data is elsewhere.\n\nThe ability to genuinely model control via FSMs (discussed later).\n\nThe ability to do time travel debugging, even in a production setting. More soon.\n\n\nCreate A Leveragable Schema\nYou need to create a spec schema for app-db. You want that leverage.\nOf course, that means you'll have to learn spec and there's\nsome overhead in that, so maybe, just maybe, in your initial experiments, you can\nget away without one. But not for long.  Promise me you'll write a spec.  Promise me.  Okay, good.\nSoon we'll look at the todomvc example\nwhich shows how to use a spec.  (Check out src/db.cljs for the spec itself, and then in src/events.cljs for\nhow to write code which checks app-db against this spec after every single event has been\nprocessed.)\nSpecs are potentially more  leveragable than types. This is a big interesting idea which is not yet mainstream.\nWatch how: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNTQ-M_uSo8\nAlso, watch the mighty Rich Hickey (poor audio):\nhttps://vimeo.com/195711510\nHow do I inspect it?\nSee FAQ #1\n\nPrevious:  This Repo's README      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  First Code Walk-Through\n\n\n\n"},"CodeWalkthrough.html":{"url":"CodeWalkthrough.html","title":"First Code Walk-Through","keywords":"","body":"Initial Code Walk-through\nAt this point, you are about 55% of the way to understanding re-frame.  You have:\n\nan overview of the 6 domino process from this repo's README\nan understanding of app state (from the previous tutorial)\n\nIn this tutorial, we look at re-frame code. By the end of it, you'll be at 70% knowledge, and ready to start coding an app.\nWhat Code?\nThis repo contains an /examples application called \"simple\",\nwhich contains 70 lines of code. We'll look at every line of the file.\nThis app:\n\ndisplays the current time in a nice big, colourful font\nprovides a single text input field, into which you can type a hex colour code, \nlike \"#CCC\", used for the time display\n\nWhen it is running, here's what it looks like:\n\nTo run the code yourself: \n\nInstall Java 8 \nInstall leiningen  (http://leiningen.org/#install)\n\nThen:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Day8/re-frame.git\ncd re-frame/examples/simple\nlein do clean, figwheel\nwait a minute and then open http://localhost:3449/example.html\n\nSo, what's just happened?  The ClojureScript code under /src has been compiled into javascript and\nput into /resources/public/js/client.js which is loaded into /resources/public/example.html (the HTML you just opened)\nFigwheel provides for hot-loading, so you can edit the source code (under /src)and watch the loaded HTML change.\nNamespace\nBecause this example is tiny, the source code is in a single namespace:\nhttps://github.com/Day8/re-frame/blob/master/examples/simple/src/simple/core.cljs\nWithin this namespace, we'll need access to both reagent and re-frame. \nSo, at the top, we start like this: \n(ns simple.core\n  (:require [reagent.core :as reagent]\n            [re-frame.core :as rf]))\n\nData Schema\nNow, normally, I'd strongly recommended that you write a quality schema\nfor your application state (the data stored in app-db). But,\nhere, to minimise cognitive load, we'll cut that corner.\nBut ... we can't cut it completely. You'll still need an\ninformal description, and here it is ... for this app app-db will contain\na two-key map like this:\n{:time       (js/Date.)  ;; current time for display\n :time-color \"#f88\"}     ;; the colour in which the time should be shown\n\nre-frame itself owns/manages app-db (see FAQ #1), and it will\nsupply the value within it (the two-key map described above) \nto your various handlers as required.\nEvents (domino 1)\nEvents are data.\nre-frame uses a vector\nformat for events. For example:\n[:delete-item 42]\n\nThe first element in the vector is a keyword which identifies the kind of event. The\nfurther elements are optional, and can provide additional data \nassociated with the event. The additional value above, 42, is \npresumably the id of the item to delete.\nHere are some other example events:\n[:admit-to-being-satoshi false]\n[:dressing/put-pants-on  \"velour flares\" {:method :left-leg-first :belt false}]\n\n(For non-trivial applications, the kind keyword will be namespaced.)\nRule:  events are pure data. No sneaky tricks like putting\ncallback functions on the wire. You know who you are.\ndispatch\nTo send an event, call dispatch with the event vector as argument: \n   (rf/dispatch [:event-id  value1 value2])\n\nIn this \"simple\" app, a :timer event is dispatched every second:\n(defn dispatch-timer-event\n  []\n  (let [now (js/Date.)]\n    (rf/dispatch [:timer now])))  ;; \nThis is an unusual source of events. Normally, it is an app's UI widgets which \ndispatch events (in response to user actions), or an HTTP POST's \non-success handler, or a websocket which gets a new packet.\nAfter dispatch\ndispatch puts an event into a queue for processing.\nSo, an event is not processed synchronously, like a function call. The processing\nhappens later - asynchronously. Very soon, but not now.\nThe consumer of the queue is a router which looks after the event's processing.\nThe router:\n\ninspects the 1st element of an event vector\nlooks for the event handler (function) which is registered\nfor this kind of event\ncalls that event handler with the necessary arguments\n\nAs a re-frame app developer, your job, then, is to write and register an\nevent handler (function) for each kind of event. \nEvent Handlers (domino 2)\nCollectively, event handlers provide the control logic in a re-frame application.\nIn this application, 3 kinds of event are dispatched: \n  :initialize\n  :time-color-change\n  :timer\n3 events means we'll be registering 3 event handlers.\nTwo ways to register\nEvent handler functions take two arguments coeffects and event, \nand they return effects.\nConceptually, you can think of coeffects as being \"the current state of the world\". \nAnd you can think of event handlers has computing and returning changes (effects) based on \n\"the current state of the world\" and the arriving event.\nEvent handlers can be registered via either reg-event-fx\nor reg-event-db  (-fx vs -db): \n\nreg-event-fx can take multiple coeffects and can return multiple effects, while \nreg-event-db allows you to write simpler handlers for the common case where you want \nthem to take only one coeffect - the current app state - and return one effect - the \nupdated app state.\n\nBecause of its simplicity, we'll be using the latter here: reg-event-db. \nreg-event-db\nWe register event handlers using re-frame's reg-event-db:\n(rf/reg-event-db\n  :the-event-id\n  the-event-handler-fn)\n\nThe handler function you provide should expect two arguments:\n\ndb, the current application state  (the value contained in app-db)\nv,  the event vector  (what was given to dispatch)\n\nSo, your function will have a signature like this: (fn [db v] ...).\nEach event handler must compute and return the new state of\nthe application, which means it returns a\nmodified version of db (or an unmodified one, if there are to be no changes to the state).\n:initialize\nOn startup, application state must be initialized. We\nwant to put a sensible value into app-db, which starts out containing {}.\nSo a (dispatch [:initialize]) will happen early in the \napp's life (more on this below), and we need to write an event handler\nfor it. \nNow this event handler is slightly unusual because not only does it not care about\nany event information passed in via the event vector, but it doesn't \neven care about the existing value in db - it just wants to plonk \na completely new value:\n(rf/reg-event-db              ;; sets up initial application state\n  :initialize\n  (fn [_ _]                   ;; the two parameters are not important here, so use _\n    {:time (js/Date.)         ;; What it returns becomes the new application state\n     :time-color \"#f88\"}))    ;; so the application state will initially be a map with two keys\n\nThis particular handler fn ignores the two parameters\n(usually called db and v) and simply returns \na map literal, which becomes the application \nstate.\nFor comparison, here's how we would have written this if we'd cared about the existing value of db: \n(rf/reg-event-db\n  :initialize\n  (fn [db _]                 ;; we use db this time, so name it\n    (-> db\n      (assoc :time (js/Date.))\n      (assoc :time-color \"#f88\")))\n\n:timer\nEarlier, we set up a timer function to (dispatch [:timer now]) every second.\nHere's how we handle it: \n(rf/reg-event-db                 ;; usage:  (rf/dispatch [:timer a-js-Date])\n  :timer\n  (fn [db [_ new-time]]          ;; \nNotes:\n\nthe event will be like [:timer a-time], so the 2nd v parameter \ndestructures to extract the a-time value\nthe handler computes a new application state from db, and returns it\n\n:time-color-change\nWhen the user enters a new colour value (via an input text box):\n(rf/reg-event-db\n  :time-color-change            ;; usage:  (rf/dispatch [:time-color-change 34562])\n  (fn [db [_ new-color-value]]\n    (assoc db :time-color new-color-value)))   ;; compute and return the new application state\n\nEffect Handlers (domino 3)\nDomino 3 realises/puts into action the effects returned by event handlers.\nIn this \"simple\" application, our event handlers are implicitly returning \nonly one effect: \"update application state\". \nThis particular effect is accomplished by a re-frame-supplied \neffect handler. So, there's nothing for us to do for this domino. We are \nusing a standard re-frame effect handler.\nAnd this is not unusual. You'll seldom have to write effect handlers, but in a later\ntutorial we'll show you more about how to do so when you need to.\nSubscription Handlers (domino 4)\nSubscription handlers, or query functions, take application state as an argument \nand run a query over it, returning something called\na \"materialised view\" of that application state.\nWhen the application state changes, subscription functions are \nre-run by re-frame, to compute new values (new materialised views).\nUltimately, the data returned by query functions is used\nin the view functions (Domino 5).\nOne subscription can \nsource data from other subscriptions. So it is possible to \ncreate a tree of dependencies.\nThe Views (Domino 5) are the leaves of this tree.  The tree's \nroot is app-db and the intermediate nodes between the two \nare computations being performed by the query functions of Domino 4.\nNow, the two examples below are trivial. They just extract part of the application\nstate and return it. So, there's virtually no computation. A more interesting tree\nof subscriptions, and more explanation, can be found in the todomvc example.\nreg-sub\nreg-sub associates a query id with a function that computes\n that query, like this:\n(rf/reg-sub\n  :some-query-id  ;; query id (used later in subscribe)\n  a-query-fn)     ;; the function which will compute the query\n\nThen later, a view function (domino 5) subscribes to a query like this:\n(subscribe [:some-query-id]), and a-query-fn will be used \nto perform the query over the application state.\nEach time application state changes, a-query-fn will be\ncalled again to compute a new materialised view (a new computation over app state)\nand that new value will be given to all view functions which are subscribed\nto :some-query-id. These view functions will then be called to compute the \nnew DOM state (because the views depend on query results which have changed).\nAlong this reactive chain of dependencies, re-frame will ensure the \nnecessary calls are made, at the right time.\nHere's the code:\n(rf/reg-sub\n  :time\n  (fn [db _]     ;; db is current app state. 2nd unused param is query vector\n    (:time db))) ;; return a query computation over the application state\n\n(rf/reg-sub\n  :time-color\n  (fn [db _]\n    (:time-color db)))\n\nLike I said, both of these queries are trivial. \nSee todomvc.subs.clj \nfor more interesting ones.\nView Functions (domino 5)\nview functions turn data into DOM.  They are \"State in, Hiccup out\" and they are Reagent \ncomponents. \nAn SPA will have lots of view functions, and collectively, \nthey render the app's entire UI.\nHiccup\nHiccup is a data format for representing HTML.\nHere's a trivial view function which returns hiccup-formatted data:\n(defn greet\n  []\n  [:div \"Hello viewers\"])  ;; means Hello viewers\n\nAnd if we call it:\n(greet)\n;; ==>  [:div \"Hello viewers\"]\n\n(first (greet))\n;; ==> :div\n\nYep, that's a vector with two elements: a keyword and a string.\nNow, greet is pretty simple because it only has the \"Hiccup Out\" part.  There's no \"Data In\".\nSubscribing\nTo render the DOM representation of some part of the app state, view functions must query \nfor that part of app-db, and that means using subscribe.\nsubscribe is always called like this:\n   (rf/subscribe  [query-id some optional query parameters])\n\nThere's only one (global) subscribe function and it takes one argument, assumed to be a vector.\nThe first element in the vector (shown above as query-id) identifies the query, \nand the other elements are optional\nquery parameters. With a traditional database a query might be:\nselect * from customers where name=\"blah\"\nIn re-frame, that would be done as follows:\n   (subscribe  [:customer-query \"blah\"]),\nwhich would return a ratom holding the customer state (a value which might change over time!).\n\nBecause subscriptions return a ratom, they must always be dereferenced to \nobtain the value. This is a recurring trap for newbies.\n\nThe View Functions\nThis view function renders the clock:\n(defn clock\n  []\n  [:div.example-clock\n   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}\n   (-> @(rf/subscribe [:time])\n       .toTimeString\n       (clojure.string/split \" \")\n       first)])\n\nAs you can see, it uses subscribe twice to obtain two pieces of data from app-db. \nIf either change, re-frame will re-run this view function.\nAnd this view function renders the input field:\n(defn color-input\n  []\n  [:div.color-input\n   \"Time color: \"\n   [:input {:type \"text\"\n            :value @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])        ;; subscribe\n            :on-change #(rf/dispatch [:time-color-change (-> % .-target .-value)])}]])  ;; \nNotice how it does BOTH a subscribe to obtain the current value AND \na dispatch to say when it has changed. \nIt is very common for view functions to run event-dispatching functions. \nThe user's interaction with the UI is usually the largest source of events.\nAnd then a view function to bring the others together, which contains no \nsubscriptions or dispatching of its own:\n(defn ui\n  []\n  [:div\n   [:h1 \"Hello world, it is now\"]\n   [clock]\n   [color-input]])\n\nNote: view functions tend to be organized into a hierarchy, often with \ndata flowing from parent to child via\nparameters. So, not every view function needs a subscription. Very often \nthe values passed in from a parent component are sufficient.\nNote: view functions should never directly access app-db. Data is \nonly ever sourced via subscriptions.\nComponents Like Templates?\nview functions are like the templates you'd find in\nDjango, Rails, Handlebars or Mustache -- they map data to HTML -- except for two massive differences:\n\nyou have the full power of ClojureScript available to you (generating a Clojure data structure). The\ndownside is that these are not \"designer friendly\" HTML templates.\nthese templates are reactive.  When their input Signals change, they\nare automatically rerun, producing new DOM. Reagent adroitly shields you from the details, but\nthe renderer of any component is wrapped by a reaction.  If any of the \"inputs\"\nto that renderer change, the renderer is rerun.\n\nKick Starting The App\nBelow, run is called to kick off the application once the HTML page has loaded.\nIt has two tasks:\n\nLoad the initial application state\nLoad the GUI by \"mounting\" the root-level function in the hierarchy \nof view functions -- in our case, ui --\nonto an existing DOM element. \n\n(defn ^:export run\n  []\n  (rf/dispatch-sync [:initialize])     ;; puts a value into application state\n  (reagent/render [ui]              ;; mount the application's ui into ''\n                  (js/document.getElementById \"app\")))\n\nAfter run is called, the app passively waits for events. \nNothing happens without an event.\nWhen it comes to establishing initial application state, you'll \nnotice the use of dispatch-sync, rather than dispatch. This is a simplifying cheat \nwhich ensures that a correct\nstructure exists in app-db before any subscriptions or event handlers run. \nSummary\nYour job, when building an app, is to: \n\ndesign your app's information model (data and schema layer)\nwrite and register event handler functions  (control and transition layer)  (domino 2)\n(once in a blue moon) write and register effect and coeffect handler \nfunctions (domino 3) which do the mutative dirty work of which we dare not \nspeak in a pure, immutable functional context. Most of the time, you'll be \nusing standard, supplied ones.\nwrite and register query functions which implement nodes in a signal graph (query layer) (domino 4)\nwrite Reagent view functions  (view layer)  (domino 5)\n\nNext Steps\nYou should now take time to carefully review the \ntodomvc example application.\nOn the one hand, it contains a lot of very helpful practical advice. On the other, it does\nuse some more advanced features like interceptors which are covered later in the docs.   \nAfter that, you'll be ready to write your own code.

It was mid 2014.\nFor all its considerable brilliance,  Reagent (+ React)\ndelivers only the 'V' part of a traditional MVC framework.\nBut apps involve much more than V. We build quite complicated\nSPAs which can run to 50K lines of code. So, I wanted to know:\nwhere does the control logic go? How is state stored & manipulated? etc.\nWe read up on Pedestal App, Flux,\nHoplon, Om, early Elm, etc., and re-frame is the architecture that\nemerged.  Since then, we've tried to keep an eye on further developments like the\nElm Architecture, Om.Next, BEST, Cycle.js, Redux, etc.  They have taught us much\nalthough we have often made different choices.\nre-frame does have parts which correspond to M, V, and C, but they aren't objects.\nIt is sufficiently different in nature\nfrom (traditional, Smalltalk) MVC that calling it MVC would be confusing.  I'd\nlove an alternative.\nPerhaps it is a RAVES framework - Reactive-Atom Views Event\nSubscription framework (I love the smell of acronym in the morning).\nOr, if we distill to pure essence, DDATWD - Derived Data All The Way Down.\nTODO: get acronym down to 3 chars! Get an image of stacked Turtles for DDATWD\ninsider's joke, conference T-Shirt.\nGuiding Philosophy\nFirst, above all, we believe in the one true Dan Holmsand, creator of Reagent, and\nhis divine instrument: the ratom.  We genuflect towards Sweden once a day.\nSecond, we believe in ClojureScript, immutable data and the process of building\na system out of pure functions.\nThird, we believe in the primacy of data, for the reasons described in\nthe main README. re-frame has a data oriented, functional architecture.\nFourth, we believe that Reactive Programming is one honking good idea.\nHow did we ever live without it? It is a quite beautiful solution to one half of re-frame's\ndata conveyance needs, but we're cautious about taking it too far - as far as, say, cycle.js.\nIt doesn't take over everything in re-frame - it just does part of the job.\nFinally, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, I was lucky enough to program in Eiffel\nwhere I was exposed to the idea of command-query separation.\nThe modern rendering of this idea is CQRS (see resources here).\nBut, even today, we still see read/write cursors and two-way data binding being promoted as a good thing.\nPlease, just say no. We already know where that goes. As your programs get bigger, the use of these two-way constructs\nwill encourage control logic into all the\nwrong places and you'll end up with a tire-fire of an Architecture. \nSincerely, The Self-appointed President of the Cursor Skeptic's Society.\nOn DSLs and Machines\nEvents are cardinal to re-frame - they're a fundamental organising principle. \nEach re-frame app will have a different set of events and your job is\nto design exactly the right ones for any given app you build. These events \nwill model \"intent\" - generally the user's.  They will be the \n\"language of the system\" and will provide the eloquence.\nAnd they are data.\nImagine we created a drawing application. And then we allowed \nsomeone to use our application and, as they did, we captured, \ninto a collection, the events caused by that user's actions \n(button clicks, drags, key presses, etc).\nThe collection of events might look like this:  \n(def collected-events\n  [\n     [:clear]\n     [:new :triangle 1 2 3]\n     [:select-object 23]\n     [:rename \"a better name\"]\n     [:delete-selection]\n     ....\n  ])\n\nNow, as an aside, consider the following assembly instructions:\nmov eax, ebx\nsub eax, 216\nmov BYTE PTR [ebx], 2\n\nAssembly instructions are represented as data, right?  Data which \nhappens to be \"executable\" by the right machine - an x86 machine in the case above.\nI'd like you to now look back at that collection of events and view it in the \nsame way - data instructions which can be executed - by the right machine.\nWait. What machine?  Well, the Event Handlers you register collectively implement \nthe \"machine\" on which these instructions execute. When you register \na new event handler using reg-event-db, \nit is like you are adding to the \"instruction set\" of the \"machine\".\nIn re-frame's README, near the top, I claimed that it had a \nData Oriented Design. Typically, that claim means you \"program\" in a data\nstructure of a certain format (Domain specific language), \nwhich is then \"executed\" by an interpreter.\nTake hiccup as an example. It is a DSL for describing DOM. \nYou program by supplying a data structure in a particular, \nknown format (the DSL) and Reagent acts as the \n\"interpreter\" which executes that \"language\":  \n[:div {:font-size 12} \"Hello\"]  ;; a data structure\nBack to re-frame. It requires that YOU design events which\ncombine into a DSL for your app\nand, at the same time, it asks YOU to provide an interpreter for\neach instruction in that DSL. When your re-frame application runs, \nit is just executing a \"program\" (collection of events) \ndynamically created by the user's event-causing actions.\nIn summary: \n\nEvents are the assembly language of your app. \nThese instructions collectively form a Domain Specific Language (DSL). The language of your system.\nThese instructions are data. \nOne instruction after another gets executed by your functioning app.\nThe Event Handlers you register collectively implement the \"machine\" on which this DSL executes. \n\nOn the subject of DSLs, watch James Reeves' excellent talk (video): Transparency through data \nIt does Event Sourcing\nHow did that error happen, you puzzle, shaking your head ruefully?\nWhat did the user do immediately prior?  What\nstate was the app in that this event was so problematic?\nTo debug, you need to know this information:\n\nthe state of the app immediately before the exception\nWhat final event then caused your app to error\n\nWell, with re-frame you need to record (have available):\n\nA recent checkpoint of the application state in app-db (perhaps the initial state)\nall the events dispatched since the last checkpoint, up to the point where the error occurred\n\nNote: that's all just data. Pure, lovely loggable data.\nIf you have that data, then you can reproduce the error.\nre-frame allows you to time travel, even in a production setting.\nTo find the bug, install the \"checkpoint\" state into app-db\nand then \"play forward\" through the collection of dispatched events.\nThe only way the app \"moves forwards\" is via events. \"Replaying events\" moves you\nstep by step towards the error causing problem.\nThis is perfect for debugging assuming, of course, you are in a position to capture\na checkpoint of app-db, and the events since then.\nHere's Martin Fowler's description of Event Sourcing.\nIt does a reduce\nHere's an interesting way of thinking about the re-frame\ndata flow ...\nFirst, imagine that all the events ever dispatched in a\ncertain running app were stored in a collection (yes, event sourcing again).\nSo, if when the app started, the user clicked on button X\nthe first item in this collection would be the event\ngenerated by that button, and then, if next the user moved\na slider, the associated event would be the next item in\nthe collection, and so on and so on. We'd end up with a\ncollection of event vectors.\nSecond, remind yourself that the combining function\nof a reduce takes two arguments:\n\nthe current state of the reduction and\nthe next collection member to fold in\n\nThen notice that reg-event-db event handlers take two arguments also:\n\ndb - the current state of app-db\nv - the next event to fold in\n\nInteresting. That's the same as a combining function in a reduce!!\nSo, now we can introduce the new mental model:  at any point in time,\nthe value in app-db is the result of performing a reduce over\nthe entire collection of events dispatched in the app up until\nthat time. The combining function for this reduce is the set of event handlers.\nIt is almost like app-db is the temporary place where this\nimagined perpetual reduce stores its on-going reduction.\nNow, in the general case, this perspective breaks down a bit,\nbecause of reg-event-fx (has -fx on the end, not -db) which\nallows:\n\nEvent handlers to produce effects beyond just application state\nchanges.\nEvent handlers to have coeffects (arguments) in addition to db and v.\n\nBut, even if it isn't the full picture, it is a very useful\nand interesting mental model. We were first exposed to this idea\nvia Elm's early use of foldp (fold from the past), which was later enshrined in the\nElm Architecture.\nDerived Data All The Way Down\nFor the love of all that is good, please watch this terrific\nStrangeLoop presentation (40 mins).\nSee what happens when you re-imagine a database as a stream!! Look at\nall the problems that evaporate.\nThink about that: shared mutable state (the root of all evil),\nre-imagined as a stream!!  Blew my socks off.\nIf, by chance, you ever watched that video (you should!), you might then twig to\nthe idea that app-db is really a derived value ... the video talks\na lot about derived values. So, yes, app-db is a derived value of the perpetual reduce.\nAnd yet, it acts as the authoritative source of state in the app. And yet,\nit isn't, it is simply a piece of derived state.  And yet, it is the source. Etc.\nThis is an infinite loop of sorts - an infinite loop of derived data.\nIt does FSM\n\nAny sufficiently complicated GUI contains an ad hoc,\ninformally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation\nof a hierarchical Finite State Machine  \n-- me, trying too hard to impress my two twitter followers\n\nevent handlers collectively\nimplement the \"control\" part of an application. Their logic\ninterprets arriving events in the context of existing state,\nand they compute the new state of the application.\nevents act a bit like the triggers in a finite state machine, and\nthe event handlers act like the rules which govern how the state machine\nmoves from one logical state to the next.\nIn the simplest\ncase, app-db will contain a single value which represents the current \"logical state\".\nFor example, there might be a single :phase key which can have values like :loading,\n:not-authenticated :waiting, etc.  Or, the \"logical state\" could be a function\nof many values in app-db.\nNot every app has lots of logical states, but some do, and if you are implementing\none of them, then formally recognising it and using a technique like\nState Charts\nwill help greatly in getting a clean design and fewer bugs.\nThe beauty of re-frame, from a FSM point of view, is that all the state is\nin one place - unlike OO systems where the state is distributed (and synchronised) \nacross many objects. So implementing your control logic as a FSM is\nfairly natural in re-frame, whereas it is often difficult and\ncontrived in other kinds of architecture (in my experience).\nSo, members of the jury, I put it to you that:\n\nthe first 3 dominoes implement an Event-driven finite-state machine\nthe last 3 dominoes render of the FSM's current state for the user to observe\n\nDepending on your app, this may or may not be a useful mental model,\nbut one thing is for sure ...\nEvents - that's the way we roll.\nInterconnections\nAsk a Systems Theorist, and they'll tell you that a system has parts and interconnections.\nHuman brains tend to focus first on the parts, and then, later, maybe on\ninterconnections. But we know better, right? We\nknow interconnections are often critical to a system.\n\"Focus on the lines between the boxes\" we lecture anyone kind enough to listen (in my case, glassy-eyed family members).\nIn the case of re-frame, dominoes are the parts, so, tick, yes, we have\nlooked at them first. Our brains are happy. But what about the interconnections?\nIf the parts are functions, as is the case with re-frame,\nwhat does it even mean to talk about interconnections between functions?\nTo answer that question, I'll rephrase it as:\nhow are the domino functions composed?\nAt the language level,\nUncle Alonzo and Uncle John tell us how a function like count composes:   \n(str (count (filter odd?  [1 2 3 4 5])))\n\nWe know when count is called, and with what\nargument, and how the value it computes becomes the arg for a further function.\nWe know how data \"flows\" into and out of the functions.\nSometimes, we'd rewrite this code as:\n(->>  [1 2 3 4 5]\n      (filter odd?)\n      count\n      str)\n\nWith this arrangement, we talk of \"threading\" data\nthrough functions. It seems to help our comprehension to conceive function\ncomposition in terms of data flow.\nre-frame delivers architecture\nby supplying the interconnections - it threads the data - it composes the dominoes - it is the lines between the boxes.\nBut it doesn't have a universal method for this \"composition\". The technique it uses varies from one domino\nneighbour-pair to the next.  Initially, it uses a queue/router, then a pipeline of interceptors\nand, finally, a Signal Graph.\nRemember back in the original README?  Our analogy for re-frame was the water cycle - water flowing around the loop,\ncompelled by different kinds of forces at different times (gravity, convection, etc), going through phase changes.\nWith this focus on interconnections, we have been looking on the \"forces\"  part of the loop.  The transport.\nFull Stack\nIf you like re-frame and want to take the principles full-stack, then\nthese resources might be interesting to you:\nCommander Patternhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1-gS0oEtYc\nDatalog All The Way Downhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0zVzzoK_E\nReactive PostgreSQL:\nhttps://yogthos.net/posts/2016-11-05-LuminusPostgresNotifications.html\nWhat Of This Romance?\nMy job is to be a relentless cheerleader for re-frame, right?\nThe gyrations of my Pom-Poms should be tectonic,\nbut the following quote makes me smile.

If your application is in one state before an \nevent is processed, it will be in a different state afterwards.\nAnd that state change is very desirable. Without the state change our \napplication can't incorporate that button click, or the newly arrived \nwebsocket message. Without mutation, an app would just sit there, stuck. \nState change is how an application \"moves forward\" - how it does its job.  Useful!\nOn the other hand, control logic and state mutation tend to be the most \ncomplex and error prone part of an app.\nYour Handling\nTo help wrangle this potential complexity, re-frame's introduction \nprovided you with a simple programming model.\nIt said you should call reg-event-db to associate an event id, \nwith a function to do the handling: \n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db        ;; \nThe function you register, handles events with a given id.  \nAnd that handler fn is expected to be pure. Given the \nvalue in app-db as the first argument, and the event (vector)\nas the second argument, it is expected to provide a new value for app-db. \nData in, a computation and data out. Pure.  \n90% Solution\nThis paradigm provides a lovely solution 90% of the time, but there are times \nwhen it isn't enough. \nHere's an example from the messy 10%. To get its job done, this handler has to side effect: \n(reg-event-db\n   :my-event\n   (fn [db [_ bool]]\n       (dispatch [:do-something-else 3])    ;; oops, side-effect\n       (assoc db :send-spam new-val)))\n\nThat dispatch queues up another event to be processed. It changes the world.\nJust to be clear, this code works.  The handler returns a new version of db, so tick,\nand that dispatch will itself be \"handled\" asynchronously\nvery shortly after this handler finishes, double tick.\nSo, you can \"get away with it\".  But it ain't pure.\nAnd here's more carnage:\n(reg-event-db\n   :my-event\n   (fn [db [_ a]]\n       (GET \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\"   ;; dirty great big side-effect\n            {:handler       #(dispatch [:process-response %1])\n             :error-handler #(dispatch [:bad-response %1])})  \n       (assoc db :flag true)))\n\nAgain, this approach will work. But that dirty great big side-effect doesn't come \nfor free. It's like a muddy monster truck has shown up in our field of white tulips.\nBad, Why?\nThe moment we stop writing pure functions there are well documented \nconsequences:\n\nCognitive load for the function's later readers goes up because they can no longer reason locally.  \nTesting becomes more difficult and involves \"mocking\".  How do we test that the http GET above is \nusing the right URL?  \"mocking\" should be mocked. It is a bad omen.\nAnd event replay-ability is lost.\n\nRegarding the 3rd point above, a re-frame application proceeds step by step, like a reduce. From the README: \n\nat any one time, the value in app-db is the result of performing a reduce over the entire \ncollection of events dispatched in the app up until that time. The combining \nfunction for this reduce is the set of registered event handlers.\n\nSuch a collection of events is replay-able which is a dream for debugging and testing. But only\nwhen all the handlers are pure. Handlers with side-effects (like that HTTP GET, or the dispatch) pollute the \nreplay, inserting extra events into it, etc., which ruins the process. \nThe 2nd Kind Of Problem\nAnd there's the other kind of purity problem:\n(reg-event-db\n   :load-localstore\n   (fn [db _]\n     (let [val (js->clj (.getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\"))]  ;; \nYou'll notice the event handler obtains data from LocalStore.\nAlthough this handler has no side effect - it doesn't need to change the world - that action of \nobtaining data from somewhere other than its arguments, means it isn't pure. \nEffects And Coeffects\nWhen striving for pure event handlers there are two considerations:\n\nEffects - what your event handler does to the world  (aka side-effects)\nCoeffects - the data your event handler requires from the world in order \nto do its computation (aka side-causes)\n\nWe'll need a solution for both.\nWhy Does This Happen?\nIt is inevitable that, say, 10% of your event handlers have effects and coeffects.\nThey have to implement the control logic of your re-frame app, which \nmeans dealing with the outside, mutative world of servers, databases, \nwindow.location, LocalStore, cookies, etc.\nThere's just no getting away from living in a mutative world, which sounds pretty ominous. Is that it? Are we doomed to impurity?\nWell, luckily a small twist in the tale makes a profound difference. We \nwill look at side-effects first. Instead of creating event handlers\nwhich do side-effects, we'll instead get them to cause side-effects.\nDoing vs Causing\nI proudly claim that this event handler is pure:\n(reg-event-db\n   :my-event\n   (fn [db _]\n      (assoc db :flag true)))\n\nTakes a db value, computes and returns a db value. No coeffects or effects. Yep, that's Pure!\nYes, all true, but ... this purity is only possible because re-frame is doing \nthe necessary side-effecting.\nWait on.  What \"necessary side-effecting\"?\nWell, application state is stored in app-db, right?  And it is a ratom. And after \neach event handler runs, it must be reset! to the newly returned \nvalue. Notice reset!.   That, right there, is the \"necessary side effecting\". \nWe get to live in our ascetic functional world because re-frame is \nlooking after the \"necessary side-effects\" on app-db.\nEt tu, React?\nTurns out it's the same pattern with Reagent/React.\nWe get to write a nice pure component, like:\n(defn say-hi\n  [name]\n  [:div \"Hello \" name])\n\nand Reagent/React mutates the DOM for us. The framework is looking \nafter the \"necessary side-effects\".\nPattern Structure\nPause and look back at say-hi. I'd like you to view it through the \nfollowing lens:  it is a pure function which returns a description \nof the side-effects required. It says: add a div element to the DOM.\nNotice that the description is declarative. We don't tell React how to do it.\nNotice also that it is data. Hiccup is just vectors and maps.\nThis is a big, important concept.  While we can't get away from certain side-effects, we can \nprogram using pure functions which describe side-effects, declaratively, in data and \nlet the backing framework look after the \"doing\" of them. Efficiently. Discreetly.\nLet's use this pattern to solve the side-effecting event-handler problem.\nEffects: The Two Step Plan\nFrom here, two steps:\n\nWork out how event handlers can declaratively describe side-effects, in data.\nWork out how re-frame can do the \"necessary side-effecting\". Efficiently and discreetly.\n\nStep 1 Of Plan\nSo, how would it look if event handlers returned side-effects, declaratively, in data?\nHere is an impure, side effecting handler:   \n(reg-event-db\n   :my-event\n   (fn [db [_ a]]\n       (dispatch [:do-something-else 3])    ;; \nHere it is re-written so as to be pure: \n(reg-event-fx                              ;;  \n   :my-event\n   (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ a]]                ;;  \n      {:db  (assoc db :flag true)          ;;  \n       :dispatch [:do-something-else 3]}))\n\nNotes: \n we're using reg-event-fx instead of reg-event-db to register  (that's -db vs -fx) \n the first parameter is no longer just db.  It is a map from which \nwe are destructuring db, i.e.\nit is a map which contains a :db key. \n The handler is returning a data structure (map) which describes two side-effects:\n\na change to application state, via the :db key\na further event, via the :dispatch key  \n\nAbove, the impure handler did a dispatch side-effect, while the pure handler described \na dispatch side-effect.\nAnother Example\nThe impure way:\n(reg-event-db\n   :my-event\n   (fn [db [_ a]]\n       (GET \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\"   ;; dirty great big side-effect\n            {:handler       #(dispatch [:process-response %1])\n             :error-handler #(dispatch [:bad-response %1])})  \n       (assoc db :flag true)))\n\nthe pure, descriptive alternative:\n(reg-event-fx\n   :my-event\n   (fn [{:keys [db]} [_ a]]\n       {:http {:method :get\n               :url    \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\"\n               :on-success  [:process-blah-response]\n               :on-fail     [:failed-blah]}\n        :db   (assoc db :flag true)}))\n\nAgain, the old way did a side-effect (Booo!) and the new way describes, declaratively,\nin data, the side-effects required (Yaaa!). \nMore on side effects in a minute, but let's double back to coeffects.\nThe Coeffects\nSo far we've written our new style -fx handlers like this:\n(reg-event-fx\n   :my-event\n   (fn [{:keys [db]} event]   ;; \nIt is now time to name that first argument:\n(reg-event-fx\n   :my-event\n   (fn [cofx event]       ;;  \nWhen you use the -fx form of registration, the first argument \nof your handler will be a map of coeffects which we name cofx.  \nIn that map will be the complete set of \"inputs\" required by your function.  The complete \nset of computational resources (data) needed to perform its computation. But how?\nThis will be explained in an upcoming tutorial, I promise, but for the moment, \ntake it as a magical given. \nOne of the keys in cofx will likely be :db and that will be the value of app-db. \nRemember this impure handler from before:\n(reg-event-db            ;;  a -db registration\n :load-localstore\n (fn [db _]              ;; db first argument \n  (let [defaults (js->clj (.getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\"))]  ;; \nIt was impure because it obtained an input from other than its arguments. \nWe'd now rewrite it as a pure handler, like this:\n(reg-event-fx             ;; notice the -fx\n   :load-localstore\n   (fn [cofx  _]          ;; cofx is a map containing inputs\n     (let [defaults (:local-store cofx)]  ;; \nSo, by some magic, not yet revealed, LocalStore will be queried before \nthis handler runs and the required value from it will be placed into \ncofx under the key :localstore for the handler to use.\nThat process leaves the handler itself pure because it only sources \ndata from arguments.\nVariations On A Theme\n-db handlers and -fx handlers are conceptually the same. They only differ numerically.\n-db handlers take one coeffect called db, and they return only one  effect (db again). \nWhereas -fx handlers take potentially many coeffects (a map of them) and they return \npotentially many effects (a map of them). So, One vs Many. \nJust to be clear, the following two handlers achieve the same thing:\n(reg-event-db\n   :set-flag\n   (fn [db [_ new-value]]\n      (assoc db :flag new-value)))\n\nvs\n(reg-event-fx\n   :set-flag\n   (fn [cofx [_ new-value]]\n      {:db (assoc (:db cofx) :flag new-value)}))\n\nObviously the -db variation is simpler and you'd use it whenever you \ncan. The -fx version is more flexible, so it will sometimes have its place.   \nSummary\n90% of the time, simple -db handlers are the right tool to use.\nBut about 10% of the time, our handlers need additional inputs (coeffects) or they need to \ncause additional side-effects (effects).  That's when you reach for -fx handlers. \n-fx handlers allow us to return effects, declaratively in data. \nIn the next tutorial, we'll shine a light on interceptors which are\nthe mechanism by which  event handlers are executed. That knowledge will give us a springboard \nto then, as a next step, better understand coeffects and effects. We'll soon be writing our own.\n\nPrevious:  Infographic Overview      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Interceptors  \n"},"Interceptors.html":{"url":"Interceptors.html","title":"Interceptors","keywords":"","body":"re-frame Interceptors\nThis tutorial explains re-frame Interceptors.

They are a central concept.\nWhat Do Interceptors Do?\nThey wrap. \nSpecifically, they wrap event handlers. \nImagine your event handler is like a piece of ham. An interceptor would be\nlike bread on either side of your ham, which makes a sandwich.\nAnd two Interceptors, in a chain, would be like you put another \npair of bread slices around the outside of the existing sandwich to make \na sandwich of the sandwich. Now it is a very thick sandwich. \nInterceptors wrap on both sides of a handler, layer after layer.\nWait, I know That Pattern!\nInterceptors implement middleware. But differently.\nTraditional middleware - often seen in web servers - creates a data \nprocessing pipeline via the nested composition of higher order functions. \nThe result is a \"stack\" of functions. Data flows through this pipeline, \nfirst forwards from one end to the other, and then backwards.\nInterceptors achieve the same outcome by assembling functions, as data, \nin a collection (a chain, rather than a stack). Data can then be iteratively\npipelined, first forwards through the functions in the chain, \nand then backwards along the same chain. \nBecause the interceptor pipeline is composed via data, rather than \nhigher order functions, it is a more flexible arrangement.  \nWhat's In The Pipeline?\nData. It flows through the pipeline being progressively transformed. \nFine. But what data?\nWith a web server, the middleware \"stack\" progressively \ntransforms a request in one direction, and, then in the backwards \nsweep, it progressively produces a response. \nIn re-frame, the forwards sweep progressively creates the coeffects \n(inputs to the event handler), while the backwards sweep processes the effects\n(outputs from the event handler).  \nI'll pause while you read that sentence again. That's the key \nconcept, right there. \nShow Me\nAt the time when you register an event handler, you can provide a chain of interceptors too. \nUsing a 3-arity registration function:\n(reg-event-db          \n   :some-id\n   [in1 in2]       ;; \n\nEach Event Handler can have its own tailored interceptor chain, provided at registration-time. \n\nHandlers Are Interceptors Too\nYou might see that registration above as associating :some-id with \ntwo things: (1) a chain of 2 interceptors [in1 in2]\nand (2) a handler.  \nExcept, the handler is turned into an interceptor too (we'll see how shortly).\nSo :some-id is only associated with one thing: a 3-chain of interceptors, \nwith the handler wrapped in an interceptor, called say h, and put on the \nend of the other two: [in1 in2 h].  \nExcept, the registration function itself, reg-event-db, actually takes this 3-chain \nand inserts its own standard interceptors, called say std1 and std2\n(which do useful things, more soon) at the front,\nso ACTUALLY, there's about 5 interceptors in the chain: [std1 std2 in1 in2 h]\nSo, ultimately, that event registration associates the event id :some-id \nwith just a chain of interceptors. Nothing more.\nLater, when a (dispatch [:some-id ...]) happens, that 5-chain of \ninterceptors will be \"executed\".  And that's how an event gets handled. \nExecuting A Chain\nThe Links Of The Chain\nEach interceptor has this form:\n{:id      :something             ;; decorative only\n :before  (fn [context] ...)     ;; returns possibly modified context\n :after   (fn [context] ...)}    ;; `identity` would be a noop\n\nThat's essentially a map of two functions. Now imagine a vector of these maps - that's an interceptor chain.  \nAbove we imagined an interceptor chain of [std1 std2 in1 in2 h]. Now we know that this is really\na vector of 5 maps: [{...} {...} {...} {...} {...}]  where each of the 5 maps have \na :before and :after fn.\nSometimes, the :before and :after fns are noops (think identity). \nTo \"execute\" an interceptor chain:\n\ncreate a context (a map, described below)\niterate forwards over the chain, calling the :before function on each interceptor\niterate over the chain in the opposite direction calling the :after function on each interceptor\n\nRemember that the last interceptor in the chain is the handler itself (wrapped up to be the :before).\nThat's it. That's how an event gets handled.\nWhat Is Context?\nSome data called a context is threaded through all the calls. \nThis value is passed as the argument to every :before and :after \nfunction and it is returned by each function, possibly modified. \nA context is a map with this structure: \n{:coeffects {:event [:some-id :some-param]\n             :db    }\n\n :effects   {:db    \n             :dispatch  [:an-event-id :param1]}\n\n :queue     \n :stack     }\n\ncontext has :coeffects and :effects which, if this was a web\nserver, would be somewhat analogous to request and response\nrespectively.\n:coeffects will contain the inputs required by the event handler\n(sitting presumably on the end of the chain). So that's \ndata like the :event being processed, and the initial state of db.\nThe handler-returned side effects are put into :effects including, \nbut not limited to, new values for db.\nThe first few interceptors in a chain (inserted by reg-event-db) \nhave :before functions which prime the :coeffects\nby adding in :event, and :db.  Of course, other interceptors can\nadd further to :coeffects.  Perhaps the event handler needs\ndata from localstore, or a random number, or a \nDataScript connection. Interceptors can build up :coeffects, via their \n:before. \nEqually, some interceptors in the chain will have :after functions\nwhich process the side effects accumulated into :effects\nincluding, but not limited to, updates to app-db.\nSelf Modifying\nThrough both stages (before and after), context contains a :queue\nof interceptors yet to be processed, and a :stack of interceptors\nalready done.\nIn advanced cases, these values can be modified by the Interceptor\nfunctions through which the context is threaded. \nWhat I'm saying is that interceptors can be dynamically added \nand removed from the :queue by existing Interceptors. \nCredit\n\nAll truths are easy to understand once they are discovered \n  -- Galileo Galilei\nThings always become obvious after the fact \n  -- Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\nThis elegant and flexible arrangement was originally \ndesigned by the talented \nPedestal Team. Thanks! \nWrite An Interceptor\nDunno about you, but I'm easily offended by underscores.\nIf we had a view  which did this: \n(dispatch [:delete-item 42])\n\nWe'd have to write this handler: \n(reg-event-db \n  :delete-item\n  (fn \n     [db [_ key-to-delete]]     ;;  \nDo you see it there? In the event destructuring!!! Almost mocking us with that\npassive aggressive, understated thing it has going on!! Co-workers\nhave said I'm \"being overly sensitive\", perhaps even pixel-ist, but \nyou can see it, right? Of course you can.\nWhat a relief it would be to not have it there, but how? We'll write an interceptor: trim-event\nOnce we have written trim-event, our registration will change to look like this:\n(reg-event-db \n  :delete-item\n  [trim-event]                ;;  \ntrim-event will need to change the :coeffects map (within context).  Specifically, it will be \nchanging the :event value within the :coeffects. \n:event will start off as [:delete-item 42], but will end up [42].  trim-event  will remove that \nleading :delete-item because, by the time the event is \nbeing processed, we already know what id it has.\nAnd, here it is: \n(def trim-event\n  (re-frame.core/->interceptor\n    :id      :trim-event\n    :before  (fn [context]\n               (let [trim-fn (fn [event] (-> event rest vec))]\n                 (update-in context [:coeffects :event] trim-fn)))))\n\nAs you read this, look back to what a context looks like.   \nNotes:\n\nWe use ->interceptor to create an interceptor (which is just a map)\nOur interceptor only has a :before function \nOur :before is given context.  It modifies it and returns it.\nThere is no :after for this Interceptor. It has nothing to do \nwith the backwards processing flow of :effects. It is concerned only \nwith :coeffects in the forward flow.\n\nWrapping Handlers\nWe're going well. Let's do an advanced wrapping. \nEarlier, in the \"Handlers Are Interceptors Too\" section, I explained that event handlers \nare wrapped in an Interceptor and placed on the end of an Interceptor chain.  Remember the \nwhole [std1 std2 in1 in2 h] thing?  \nWe'll now look at the h bit. How does an event handler get wrapped to be an Interceptor?\nReminder - there's two kinds of handler:\n\nthe -db variety registered by reg-event-db\nthe -fx variety registered by reg-event-fx\n\nI'll now show how to wrap the -db variety. \nReminder: here's what a -db handler looks like:\n(fn [db event]               ;; takes two params\n  (assoc db :flag true))     ;; returns a new db\n\nSo, we'll be writing a function which takes a -db handler and returns an \nInterceptor which wraps that handler:\n(defn db-handler->interceptor\n  [db-handler-fn]\n  (re-frame.core/->interceptor     ;; a utility function supplied by re-frame\n    :id     :db-handler            ;; ids are decorative only\n    :before (fn [context]\n              (let [{:keys [db event]} (:coeffects context)    ;; extract db and event from coeffects\n                    new-db (db-handler-fn db event)]           ;; call the handler \n                 (assoc-in context [:effects :db] new-db)))))) ;; put db back into :effects\n\nNotes:\n\nNotice how this wrapper extracts data from the context's :coeffects \nand then calls the handler with that data  (a handler must be called with db and event)\nEqually notice how this wrapping takes the return value from the -db \nhandler and puts it into context's :effects\nThe modified context (it has a new :effects) is returned\nThis is all done in :before.  There is no :after (it is a noop).  But this \ncould have been reversed with the work happening in :after and :before a noop. Shrug.\nRemember that this Interceptor will be on the end of a chain. \n\nFeeling confident?  Try writing the wrapper for -fx handlers - it is just a small variation.  \nSummary\nIn this tutorial, we've learned: \n1. When you register an event handler, you can supply a collection of interceptors:\n (reg-event-db          \n    :some-id\n    [in1 in2]       ;; \n2. When you are registering an event handler, you are associating an event id with a chain of interceptors including:\n\nthe ones you supply (optional)\nan extra one on the end, which wraps the handler itself \na couple at the beginning of the chain, put there by the reg-event-db or reg-event-fx. \n\n3. An Interceptor Chain is executed in two stages. First a forwards sweep in which \n  all :before functions are called, and then second, a backwards sweep in which the \n  :after functions are called. A context will be threaded through all these calls.\n4. Interceptors do interesting things:\n\nadd to coeffects  (data inputs to the handler)\nprocess side effects (returned by a handler)\nproduce logs \nfurther process    \n\nIn the next Tutorial, we'll look at (side) Effects in more depth.  Later again, we'll look at Coeffects.   \nAppendix\nThe Built-in Interceptors\nre-frame comes with some built-in Interceptors:\n\ndebug: log each event as it is processed. Shows incremental clojure.data/diff reports.\ntrim-v:  a convenience. More readable handlers.  \n\nAnd some Interceptor factories (functions that return Interceptors):\n\nenrich:  perform additional computations (validations?), after the handler has run. More derived data flowing.\nafter: perform side effects, after a handler has run.  Eg: use it to report if the data in app-db matches a schema.   \npath:  a convenience. Simplifies our handlers. Acts almost like update-in.\n\nIn addition, a Library like re-frame-undo provides an Interceptor \nfactory called undoable which checkpoints app state.\nTo use them, first require them:\n(ns my.core\n  (:require\n    [re-frame.core :refer [debug path]])\n\n\nPrevious:  Effectful Handlers      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Effects  \n"},"Effects.html":{"url":"Effects.html","title":"Effects","keywords":"","body":"Effects\nAbout 10% of the time, event handlers need to cause side effects.\nThis tutorial explains how side effects are actioned,\nhow you can create your own side effects, and how you can \nmake side effects a noop in event replays.\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nWhere Effects Come From\nThe Effects Map\nInfinite Effects\nExtensible Side Effects\nWriting An Effect Handler\n:db Not Always Needed\nWhat Makes This Work?\nOrder Of Effects?\nEffects With No Data\nTesting And Noops\nSummary\nExternal Effects\n\n\nWhere Effects Come From\nWhen an event handler is registered via reg-event-fx, it must return effects.\nLike this:  \n(reg-event-fx              ;; -fx registration, not -db registration\n  :my-event\n  (fn [cofx [_ a]]        ;; 1st argument is coeffects, instead of db     \n    {:db       (assoc (:db cofx) :flag  a)         \n     :dispatch [:do-something-else 3]}))   ;; return effects\n\n-fx handlers return a description of the side-effects required, and that description is a map. \nThe Effects Map\nAn effects map contains instructions.\nEach key/value pair in the map is one instruction - the key uniquely identifies\nthe particular side effect required, and the value for that key provides\nfurther data. The structure of value is different for each side-effect.\nHere's the two instructions from the example above:\n{:db       (assoc db :flag  a)         ;; side effect on app-db\n :dispatch [:do-something-else 3]}     ;; dispatch this event\n\nThe :db key instructs that \"app-db\" should be reset! to the\nvalue supplied.\nAnd the :dispatch key instructs that an event should be\ndispatched. The value is the vector to dispatch.\nThere's many other possible\neffects, like for example :dispatch-later or :set-local-store. \nAnd so on. And so on. Which brings us to a problem.\nInfinite Effects\nWhile re-frame supplies a number of builtin effects, the set of\npossible effects is open ended.\nWhat if you use PostgreSQL and want an effect which issues mutating\nqueries?  Or what if you want to send logs to Logentries or metrics to DataDog.\nOr write values to windows.location. And what happens if your database is\nX, Y or Z?\nThe list of effects is long and varied, with everyone needing to use a\ndifferent combination.\nSo effect handling has to be extensible. You need a way to define \nyour own side effects.\nExtensible Side Effects\nre-frame provides a function reg-fx through which you can register \nyour own Effect Handlers.\nUse it like this:\n(reg-fx         ;;  \n   (fn [value]  ;;  \n      ...\n      ))\n\n  the key for the effect.  When later an effects map contains \nthe key :butterfly, the function we are registering will be used to action it. \n  the function which actions the side effect. Later, it will be called \nwith one argument - the value in the effects map, for this key. \nSo, if an event handler returned these two effects:\n{:dispatch   [:save-maiden 42]\n :butterfly  \"Flapping\"}         ;; butterfly effect, but no chaos !!\n\nThen the function we registered for :butterfly would be called to handle \nthat effect. And it would be called with the parameter \"Flapping\".\nSo, terminology:\n\n:butterfly is an \"effect key\"\nand the function registered is an \"effect handler\".\n\nSo re-frame has both event handlers and effect handlers and they are \ndifferent, despite them both starting with e and ending in t!!\nWriting An Effect Handler\nA word of advice - make them as simple as possible, and then \nsimplify them further.  You don't want them containing any fancy logic.\nWhy?  Well, because they are all side-effecty they will be a pain \nto test rigorously. And the combination of fancy logic and limited \ntesting always ends in tears.  If not now, later.\nA second word of advice - when you create an effect handler, \nyou also have to design (and document!) the structure of the \nvalue expected. \nWhen you do, realise that you are designing a nano DSL for value and try to\nmake that design simple too. If you resist being terse and smart, and instead, favor slightly \nverbose and obvious, your future self will thank you. Create as little \ncognitive overhead as possible for the eventual readers of your effectful code.\nThis advice coming from the guy who named effects fx ... Oh, the hypocrisy.\nIn my defence, here's the built-in effect handler for :db:\n(reg-fx\n  :db\n  (fn [value]\n    (reset! re-frame.db/app-db value)))\n\nSo, yeah, simple ... and, because of it, I can almost guarantee there's no bug in ... bang, crash, smoke, flames.\n\nNote: the return value of an effect handler is ignored.\n\n:db Not Always Needed\nAn effects map does not need to include the effect key :db. \nIt is perfectly valid for an event handler \nto not change app-db. \nIn fact, it is perfectly valid for an event handler to return \nan effects map of {}.  Slightly puzzling, but not a problem.  \nWhat Makes This Work?\nA silently inserted interceptor.\nWhenever you register an event handler via either reg-event-db \nor reg-event-fx, an interceptor, cunningly named do-fx,is inserted at the beginning of the chain. \nExample: if your event handler registration looked like this:\n(reg-event-fx\n  :some-id\n  [debug (path :right)]     ;; \nWhile it might look like you have registered with 2 interceptors, \nreg-event-fx will make it 3: \n[do-fx debug (path :right)]\n\nIt silently inserts do-fx at the front, and this is a good thing. \nThe placement of do-fx at the beginning of the interceptor chain means \nits :after function would be the final act when the chain is executed \n(forwards and then backwards, as described in the Interceptor Tutorial).\nIn this final act, the :after function extracts :effects from context \nand simply iterates across the key/value pairs it contains, calling the \nregistered \"effect handlers\" for each.\n\nFor the record, the FISA Court requires that we deny all claims \nthat do-fx is secretly injected NSA surveillance-ware. \nWe also note that you've been particularly sloppy with your personal \ngrooming today, including that you forgot to clean your teeth. Again.\n\nIf ever you want to take control of the way effect handling is done, \ncreate your own alternative to reg-event-fx and, in it, inject\nyour own version of the do-fx interceptor at the front \nof the interceptor chain.  It is only a few lines of code. \nOrder Of Effects?\nThere isn't one.\ndo-fx does not currently provide you with control over the order in \nwhich side effects occur. The :db side effect \nmight happen before :dispatch, or not. You can't rely on it.\nNote: if you feel you need ordering, then please \nopen an issue and explain the usecase. The current absence of \ngood usecases is the reason ordering isn't implemented. So give \nus a usercase and we'll revisit, maybe. \nFurther Note: if later ordering was needed, it might be handled via \nmetadata on :effects. Also, perhaps by allowing reg-fx to optionally \ntake two functions:\n\nan effects pre-process fn  :effects returns :effects\nthe effects handler (as already described above). \n\nAnyway, these are all just possibilities. But not needed or implemented yet. \nEffects With No Data\nSome effects have no associated data:\n(reg-event-fx\n  :some-id\n  (fn [coeffect _] \n     {:exit-fullscreen nil}))    ;;   \nIn these cases, although it looks odd, just supply nil as the value for this key.\nThe associated effect handler would look like:\n(reg-fx\n  :exit-fullscreen\n  (fn [_]             ;; we don't bother with that nil value\n     (.exitFullscreen js/document)))\n\nTesting And Noops\nWhen you are running tests or replaying events, it is sometimes \nuseful to stub out effects.\nThis is easily done - you simply register a noop effect handler. \nWant to stub out the :dispatch effect?  Do this:\n(reg-fx\n  :dispatch\n  (fn [_] ))    ;; a noop\n\nIf your test does alter registered effect handlers, and you are using cljs.test,\nthen you can use a fixture to restore all effect handlers at the end of your test: \n(defn fixture-re-frame\n  []\n  (let [restore-re-frame (atom nil)]\n    {:before #(reset! restore-re-frame (re-frame.core/make-restore-fn))\n     :after  #(@restore-re-frame)}))\n\n(use-fixtures :each (fixture-re-frame))\n\nre-frame.core/make-restore-fn creates a checkpoint for re-frame state (including \nregistered handlers) to which you can return. \nExisting Effect Handlers\nBuilt-in effect handlers are detailed the API document.\nAnd please review the External-Resources document for a list of 3rd party Effect Handlers.\nSummary\nThe 4 Point Summary in note form:\n\nEvent handlers should only return effect declaratively\nThey return a map like {:effect1 value1 :effect2 value2}\nKeys of this map can refer to builtin effects handlers (see below) or custom ones\nWe use reg-fx to register our own effects handlers, built-in ones are already registered\n\n\nPrevious:  Interceptors      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Coeffects  \n"},"Coeffects.html":{"url":"Coeffects.html","title":"Coeffects","keywords":"","body":"Coeffects\nThis tutorial explains coeffects.\nIt explains what they are, how they can be \"injected\", and how \nto manage them in tests.\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nWhat Are They?\nAn Example\nHow We Want It\nAbracadabra\nWhich Interceptors?\ninject-cofx\nMore inject-cofx\nMeet reg-cofx\nExample Of reg-cofx\nAnother Example Of reg-cofx\nSecret Interceptors\nTesting\nThe 5 Point Summary\n\n\nWhat Are They?\ncoeffects are the data resources that an event handler needs \nto perform its computation.\nBecause the majority of event handlers only need db and \nevent, there's a specific registration function, called reg-event-db, \nwhich delivers ONLY these two coeffects as arguments to an event \nhandler, making this common case easy to program.\nBut sometimes an event handler needs other data inputs\nto perform its computation.  Things like a random number, or a GUID,\nor the current datetime. Perhaps it needs access to a\nDataScript connection.\nAn Example\nThis handler obtains data directly from LocalStore:\n(reg-event-db\n   :load-defaults\n   (fn [db _]\n     (let [val (js->clj (.getItem js/localStorage \"defaults-key\"))]  ;; \nThis works, but there's a cost.\nBecause it has directly accessed LocalStore, this event handler is not \npure, and impure functions cause well-documented paper cuts.\nHow We Want It\nOur goal in this tutorial will be to rewrite this event handler so \nthat it only uses data from arguments. This will take a few steps.\nThe first is that we switch to\nusing reg-event-fx (instead of reg-event-db).\nEvent handlers registered via reg-event-fx are slightly \ndifferent to those registered via reg-event-db. -fx handlers \nget two arguments, but the first is not db. Instead it \nis an argument which we will call cofx (that's a nice distinct \nname which will aid communication). \nPrevious tutorials showed there's a :db key in cofx.  We \nnow want cofx to have other keys and values, like this: \n(reg-event-fx                     ;; note: -fx \n   :load-defaults\n   (fn [cofx event]                 ;; cofx means coeffects\n     (let [val (:local-store cofx)  ;; \nNotice how cofx magically contains a :local-store key with the \nright value. Nice! But how do we make this magic happen? \nAbracadabra\nEach time an event handler is executed, a brand new context (map)\nis created, and within that context is a :coeffects key which \nis a further map (initially empty). \nThat pristine context value (containing a pristine :coeffects map) is threaded \nthrough a chain of Interceptors before it finally reaches our event handler,\nwhich sits on the end of the chain, itself wrapped up in an interceptor. We knowthis story well from a previous tutorial. \nSo, all members of the Interceptor chain have the opportunity to assoc into :coeffects \nwithin their :before function, cumulatively building up what it holds.  Later, our event handler, \nwhich sits on the end of the chain, magically finds just the \nright data (like a value for the key :local-store) in its first cofx argument. \nSo, it is the event handler's Interceptors which put it there.\nWhich Interceptors?\nIf Interceptors put data in :coeffects, then we'll need to add the right ones\nwhen we register our event handler.\nSomething like this (this handler is the same as before, except for one detail):    \n(reg-event-fx                     \n   :load-defaults\n   [ (inject-cofx :local-store \"defaults-key\") ]     ;; \nLook at that - my event handler has a new Interceptor!  It is injecting the \nright key/value pair (:local-store)\ninto context's :coeffects, which itself then goes on to be the first argument \nto our event handler (cofx).\ninject-cofx\ninject-cofx is part of the re-frame API.\nIt is a function which returns an Interceptor whose :before function loads \na key/value pair into a context's :coeffects map.\ninject-cofx takes either one or two arguments. The first is always the id of the coeffect \nrequired (called a cofx-id). The 2nd is an optional addition value. \nSo, in the case above, the cofx-id was :local-store  and the additional value \nwas \"defaults-key\" which was presumably the LocalStore key. \nMore inject-cofx\nHere's some other usage examples:\n\n(inject-cofx :random-int 10) \n(inject-cofx :guid)\n(inject-cofx :now)\n\nI could create an event handler which has access to 3 coeffects:\n(reg-event-fx \n    :some-id \n    [(inject-cofx :random-int 10) (inject-cofx :now)  (inject-cofx :local-store \"blah\")]  ;; 3\n    (fn [cofx _]\n       ... in here I can access cofx's keys :now :local-store and :random-int))\n\nBut that's probably just greedy, and not very useful.   \nAnd so, to the final piece in the puzzle: how does inject-cofx \nknow what to do when it is given :now or :local-store? \nEach cofx-id requires a different action.\nMeet reg-cofx\nThis function is also part of the re-frame API.\nIt allows you to associate a cofx-id (like :now or :local-store) with a \nhandler function that injects the right key/value pair.\nThe function you register will be passed two arguments:\n\na :coeffects map (to which it should add a key/value pair), and \noptionally, the additional value supplied to inject-cofx\n\nand it is expected to return a modified :coeffects map.\nExample Of reg-cofx\nAbove, we wrote an event handler that wanted :now data to be available.  Here \nis how a handler could be registered for :now:\n(reg-cofx               ;; registration function\n   :now                 ;; what cofx-id are we registering\n   (fn [coeffects _]    ;; second parameter not used in this case\n      (assoc coeffects :now (js.Date.))))   ;; add :now key, with value\n\nThe outcome is:    \n\nbecause that cofx handler above is now registered for :now, I can \nadd an Interceptor to an event handler which \nlooks like (inject-cofx :now)\nwhich means within that event handler I can access a :now value from cofx\n\nAs a result, my event handler is pure.\nAnother Example Of reg-cofx\nThis: \n(reg-cofx               ;; new registration function\n   :local-store \n   (fn [coeffects local-store-key]\n      (assoc coeffects \n             :local-store\n             (js->clj (.getItem js/localStorage local-store-key)))))\n\nWith these two registrations in place, I could now use both (inject-cofx :now) and \n(inject-cofx :local-store \"blah\") in an event handler's interceptor chain. \nTo put this another way:  I can't use (inject-cofx :blah) UNLESS I have previously \nused reg-cofx to register a handler for :blah. Otherwise inject-cofx doesn't \nknow how to inject a :blah. \nSecret Interceptors\nIn a previous tutorial we learned that reg-events-db \nand reg-events-fx add Interceptors to the front of any chain \nduring registration. We found they inserted an Interceptor called do-fx. \nI can now reveal that \nthey also add (inject-cofx :db) at the front of each chain.\nGuess what that injects into the :coeffects of every event handler? This is how :db\nis always available to event handlers. \nOkay, so that was the last surprise. Now you know everything.\nIf ever you wanted to use DataScript, instead of an atom-containing-a-map\nlike app-db, you'd replace reg-event-db and reg-event-fx with your own\nregistration functions and have them auto insert the DataScript connection.\nTesting\nDuring testing, you may want to stub out certain coeffects.\nYou may, for example, want to test that an event handler works \nusing a specific now. \nIn your test, you'd mock out the cofx handler:\n(reg-cofx\n   :now\n   (fn [coeffects _]\n      (assoc coeffects :now (js/Date. 2016 1 1)))   ;; now was then\n\nIf your test does alter registered coeffect handlers, and you are using cljs.test,\nthen you can use a fixture to restore all coeffects at the end of your test: \n(defn fixture-re-frame\n  []\n  (let [restore-re-frame (atom nil)]\n    {:before #(reset! restore-re-frame (re-frame.core/make-restore-fn))\n     :after  #(@restore-re-frame)}))\n\n(use-fixtures :each (fixture-re-frame))\n\nre-frame.core/make-restore-fn creates a checkpoint for re-frame state (including \nregistered handlers) to which you can return. \nThe 5 Point Summary\nIn note form:\n\nEvent handlers should only source data from their arguments\nWe want to \"inject\" required data into the first, cofx argument\nWe use the (inject-cofx :key) interceptor in registration of the event handler\nIt will look up the registered cofx handler for that :key to do the injection\nWe must have previously registered a cofx handler via reg-cofx\n\n\nPrevious:  Effects      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Infographic\n"},"SubscriptionInfographic.html":{"url":"SubscriptionInfographic.html","title":"Infographic","keywords":"","body":"Subscription Infographic\nThere's two things to do here. \nFirst, please read through the \nannotated subscription code in the todomvc example.\nThen, look at this Infographic:\n\n\nPrevious:  Coeffects      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Correcting a wrong      \n\n\n\n"},"SubscriptionsCleanup.html":{"url":"SubscriptionsCleanup.html","title":"Correcting a wrong","keywords":"","body":"Subscriptions Cleanup\nThere's a problem and we need to fix it. \nThe Problem\nThe simple example, used in the earlier code walk through, is not idomatic re-frame. It has a flaw. \nIt does not obey the re-frame rule:  keep views as simple as possible.\nA view shouldn't do any computation on input data. Its job is just to compute hiccup.\nThe subscriptions it uses should deliver the data already in the right \nstructure, ready for use in hiccup generation.\nJust Look\nHere be the horrors: \n(defn clock\n  []\n  [:div.example-clock\n   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}\n   (-> @(rf/subscribe [:time])\n       .toTimeString\n       (clojure.string/split \" \")\n       first)])\n\nThat view obtains data from a [:time] subscription and then it \nmassages that data into the form it needs for use in the hiccup.  We don't like that. \nThe Solution\nInstead, we want to use a new [:time-str] subscription which will deliver the data all ready to go, so \nthe view is 100% concerned with hiccup generation only. Like this:\n(defn clock\n  []\n  [:div.example-clock\n   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}\n   @(rf/subscribe [:time-str])])\n\nWhich, in turn, means we must write this time-str subscription handler:\n(reg-sub \n  :time-str \n  (fn [_ _]  \n    (subscribe [:time]))\n  (fn [t _] \n    (-> t\n       .toTimeString\n       (clojure.string/split \" \")\n       first)))\n\nMuch better. \nYou'll notice this new subscription handler belongs to the \"Level 3\" \nlayer of the reactive flow.  See the Infographic.\nAnother Technique\nAbove, I suggested this:\n(defn clock\n  []\n  [:div.example-clock\n   {:style {:color @(rf/subscribe [:time-color])}}\n   @(rf/subscribe [:time-str])])\n\nBut that may offend your aesthetics. Too much noise with those two @? \nTo clean this up, we can define a new listen function: \n(defn listen \n  [query-v]\n  @(rf/subscribe query-v))\n\nAnd then rewrite: \n(defn clock\n  []\n  [:div.example-clock\n   {:style {:color (listen [:time-color])}}\n   (listen [:time-str])])\n\nSo, at the cost of writing your own function, listen, the code is now less noisy \nAND there's less chance of us forgetting an @ (which can lead to odd problems).\nLambdaIsland Naming  (LIN)\nI've ended up quite liking the alternative names \nsuggested by Lambda Island Videos:\n(def evt re-frame.core/dispatch)\n\nSay It Again\nSo, if, in code review, you saw this view function:\n(defn show-items\n  []\n  (let [sorted-items (sort @(subscribe [:items]))]  \n    (into [:div] (for [i sorted-items] [item-view i]))))\n\nWhat would you (supportively) object to?\nThat sort, right?  Computation in the view. Instead, we want exactly the right data \ndelivered to the view - no further computation required - the view's job is to simply make hiccup. \nThe solution is to create a subscription that delivers items already sorted. \n(reg-sub \n   :sorted-items \n   (fn [_ _]  (subscribe [:items]))\n   (fn [items _]\n      (sort items))\n\nNow, in this case the computation is a bit trivial, but the moment it is\na little tricky, you'll want to test it.  So separating it out from the \nview will make that easier. \nTo make it testable, you may structure like this:\n(defn item-sorter\n  [items _]\n  (sort items))\n\n(reg-sub \n   :sorted-items \n   (fn [_ _]  (subscribe [:items]))\n   item-sorter)\n\nNow it is easy to test item-sorter independently.  \nAnd There's Another Benefit\nre-frame de-duplicates signal graph nodes.\nIf, for example, two views wanted to (subscribe [:sorted-items]) only the one node \n(in the signal graph) would be created.  Only one node would be doing that \npotentially expensive sorting operation (when items changed) and values from \nit would be flowing through to both views.\nThat sort of efficiency can't happen if this views themselves are doing the sort.\nde-duplication\nAs I described above, two, or more, concurrent subscriptions for the same query will source \nreactive updates from the one executing handler - from the one node in the signal graph.\nHow do we know if two subscriptions are \"the same\"?  Answer: two subscriptions\nare the same if their query vectors test = to each other.\nSo, these two subscriptions are not \"the same\":  [:some-event 42]  [:some-event \"blah\"]. Even\nthough they involve the same event id, :some-event, the query vectors do not test =.\nThis feature shakes out nicely because re-frame has a data oriented design. \nA Final FAQ\nThe following issue comes up a bit.\nYou will end up with a bunch of level 1 reg-sub which\nlook the same (they directly extract a path within app-db):\n(reg-sub \n   :a \n   (fn [db _] \n     (:a db)))\n\n(reg-sub \n   :b \n   (fn [db _] \n     (-> db :top :b)))\n\nNow, you think and design abstractly for a living, and that repetition will feel uncomfortable. It will\ncall to you like a Siren: \"refaaaaactoooor meeeee\". \"Maaaake it DRYYYY\".\nSo here's my tip:  tie yourself to the mast and sail on. That repetition is good. It is serving a purpose.\nJust sail on.\nThe WORST thing you can do is to flex your magnificent abstraction muscles \nand create something like this:\n(reg-sub \n   :extract-any-path\n   (fn [db path]\n     (get-in db path))\n\n\"Genius!\", you think to yourself.  \"Now I only need one direct reg-sub and I supply a path to it. \nA read-only cursor of sorts.  Look at the code I can delete.\"\nNeat and minimal it most certainly is, yes, but genius it isn't. You are now asking the \ncode USING the subscription to provide the path.  You have traded some innocuous \nrepetition for longer term fragility, and that's not a good trade.\nWhat fragility? Well, the view which subscribes using, say, (subscribe [:extract-any-path [:a]]) \nnow \"knows\" about (depends on) the structure within app-db.\nWhat happens when you inevitably restructure app-db and put that :a path under\nanother high level branch of app-db?  You will have to run around all the views,\nlooking for the paths supplied, knowing which to alter and which to leave alone. \nFragile. \nWe want our views to declaratively ask for data, but they should have \nno idea where it comes from. It is the job of a subscription to know where data comes from. \nRemember our rule at the top:  keep views as simple as possible. \nDon't give them knowledge or tasks outside their remit.\n\nPrevious:  Infographic      \nUp:        Index      \nNext:      Flow Mechanics       \n\n\n\n"},"SubscriptionFlow.html":{"url":"SubscriptionFlow.html","title":"Flow Mechanics","keywords":"","body":"\nIn a rush?

You can swap! and reset! them, watch them, etc.\nFrom a ClojureScript perspective, the purpose of an atom is to hold mutable data.  From a re-frame\nperspective, we'll tweak that paradigm slightly and view a ratom as having a value that\nchanges over time.  Seems like a subtle distinction, I know, but because of it, re-frame sees a\nratom as a Signal. \nA Signal is a value that changes over time.  So it is a stream of values. Each time a ratom gets\nreset! that's a new value in the stream. \nThe 2nd building block, reaction, acts a bit like a function. It's a macro which wraps some\ncomputation (a block of code) and returns a ratom holding the result of that computation.\nThe magic thing about a reaction is that the computation it wraps will be automatically\nre-run  whenever 'its inputs' change, producing a new output (return) value.\nEh, how?\nWell, the computation is just a block of code, and if that code dereferences one or\nmore ratoms, it will be automatically re-run (recomputing a new return value) whenever any\nof these dereferenced ratoms change.\nTo put that yet another way, a reaction detects a computation's input Signals (aka input ratoms)\nand it will watch them, and when, later, it detects a change in one of them,  it will re-run that\ncomputation, and it will reset! the new result of that computation into the ratom originally returned.\nSo, the ratom returned by a reaction is itself a Signal. Its value will change over time when\nthe computation is re-run.\nSo, via the interplay between ratoms and reactions,  values 'flow' into computations and out\nagain, and then into further computations, etc.  \"Values\" flow (propagate) through the Signal graph.\nBut this Signal graph must be without cycles, because cycles cause mayhem!  re-frame achieves\na unidirectional flow.\nRight, so that was a lot of words. Some code to clarify:\n(ns example1\n (:require-macros [reagent.ratom :refer [reaction]])  ;; reaction is a macro\n (:require        [reagent.core  :as    reagent]))\n\n(def app-db  (reagent/atom {:a 1}))           ;; our root ratom  (signal)\n\n(def ratom2  (reaction {:b (:a @app-db)}))    ;; reaction wraps a computation, returns a signal\n(def ratom3  (reaction (condp = (:b @ratom2)  ;; reaction wraps another computation\n                             0 \"World\"\n                             1 \"Hello\")))\n\n;; Notice that both computations above involve de-referencing a ratom:\n;;   - app-db in one case\n;;   - ratom2 in the other\n;; Notice that both reactions above return a ratom.\n;; Those returned ratoms hold the (time varying) value of the computations.\n\n(println @ratom2)    ;; ==>  {:b 1}       ;; a computed result, involving @app-db\n(println @ratom3)    ;; ==> \"Hello\"       ;; a computed result, involving @ratom2\n\n(reset!  app-db  {:a 0})       ;; this change to app-db, triggers re-computation\n                               ;; of ratom2\n                               ;; which, in turn, causes a re-computation of ratom3\n\n(println @ratom2)    ;; ==>  {:b 0}    ;; ratom2 is result of {:b (:a @app-db)}\n(println @ratom3)    ;; ==> \"World\"    ;; ratom3 is automatically updated too.\n\nSo, in FRP-ish terms, a reaction will produce a \"stream\" of values over time (it is a Signal),\naccessible via the ratom it returns.\nComponents  (view functions)\nWhen using Reagent, your primary job is to write one or more components. \nThis is the view layer.\nThink about components as pure functions - data in, Hiccup out.  Hiccup is\nClojureScript data structures which represent DOM. Here's a trivial component:\n(defn greet\n  []\n  [:div \"Hello ratoms and reactions\"])\n\nAnd if we call it:\n(greet)\n;; ==>  [:div \"Hello ratoms and reactions\"]\n\nYou'll notice that our component is a regular Clojure function, nothing special. In this case, it takes\nno parameters and it returns a ClojureScript vector (formatted as Hiccup).\nHere is a slightly more interesting (parameterised) component (function):\n(defn greet                    ;; greet has a parameter now\n  [name]                       ;; 'name' is a ratom  holding a string\n  [:div \"Hello \"  @name])      ;; dereference 'name' to extract the contained value\n\n;; create a ratom, containing a string\n(def n (reagent/atom \"re-frame\"))\n\n;; call our `component` function, passing in a ratom\n(greet n)\n;; ==>  [:div \"Hello \" \"re-frame\"]    returns a vector\n\nSo components are easy - at core they are a render function which turns data into\nHiccup (which will later become DOM).\nNow, let's introduce reaction into this mix.  On the one hand, I'm complicating things\nby doing this, because Reagent allows you to be ignorant of the mechanics I'm about to show\nyou. (It invisibly wraps your components in a reaction allowing you to be blissfully\nignorant of how the magic happens.)\nOn the other hand, it is useful to understand exactly how the Reagent Signal graph is wired. \n(defn greet                ;; a component - data in, Hiccup out.\n  [name]                   ;; name is a ratom\n  [:div \"Hello \"  @name])  ;; dereference name here, to extract the value within\n\n(def n (reagent/atom \"re-frame\"))\n\n;; The computation '(greet n)' returns Hiccup which is stored into 'hiccup-ratom'\n(def hiccup-ratom  (reaction (greet n)))    ;;   [:div \"Hello \" \"re-frame\"]    ;; returns hiccup  (a vector of stuff)\n\n;; now change 'n'\n;; 'n' is an input Signal for the reaction above.\n;; Warning: 'n' is not an input signal because it is a parameter. Rather, it is\n;; because 'n' is dereferenced within the execution of the reaction's computation.\n;; reaction notices what ratoms are dereferenced in its computation, and watches\n;; them for changes.\n(reset! n \"blah\")            ;;    n changes\n\n;; The reaction above will notice the change to 'n' ...\n;; ... and will re-run its computation ...\n;; ... which will have a new \"return value\"...\n;; ... which will be \"reset!\" into \"hiccup-ratom\"\n(println @hiccup-ratom)\n;; ==>   [:div \"Hello \" \"blah\"]    ;; yep, there's the new value\n\nSo, as n changes value over time (via a reset!), the output of the computation (greet n)\nchanges, which in turn means that the value in hiccup-ratom changes. Both n and\nhiccup-ratom are FRP Signals. The Signal graph we created causes data to flow from\nn into hiccup-ratom.\nDerived Data, flowing.\nTruth Interlude\nI haven't been entirely straight with you:\n\nReagent re-runs reactions (re-computations) via requestAnimationFrame. So a\nre-computation happens about 16ms after an input Signals change is detected, or after the\ncurrent thread of processing finishes, whichever is the greater. So if you are in a bREPL\nand you run the lines of code above one after the other too quickly,  you might not see the\nre-computation done immediately after n gets reset!, because the next animationFrame\nhasn't run (yet).  But you could add a (reagent.core/flush) after the reset! to force\nre-computation to happen straight away.\n\nreaction doesn't actually return a ratom.  But it returns something that has\nratom-nature, so we'll happily continue believing it is a ratom and no harm will come to us.\n\n\nOn with the rest of my lies and distortions...\nreg-sub-raw\nThis low level part of the API provides a way to register a subscription handler - so \nthe intent is similar to reg-sub.\nYou use it like other registration functions: \n(re-frame.core/reg-sub-raw   ;; it is part of the API\n  :query-id     ;; later use (subscribe [:query-id])\n  some-fn)      ;; this function provides the reactive stream\n\nThe interesting bit is how some-fn is written. Here's an example:\n(defn some-fn \n  [app-db event]    ;; app-db is not a value, it is a reagent/atom\n  (reaction (get-in @app-db [:some :path])))  ;; returns a reaction\n\nNotice:\n\napp-db is a reagent/atom. It is not a value like reg-sub gets.\nit returns a reaction which does a computation. It does not return a value like reg-sub does.\nWithin that reaction app-db is deref-ed (see use of @) \n\nAs a result of point 3, each time app-db changes, the wrapped reaction will rerun.\napp-db is an input signal to that reaction. \nUnlike reg-sub, there is no 3-arity version of reg-sub-raw, so there's no way for you to provide an input signals function.\nInstead, even simpler, you can just use subscribe within the reaction itself. For example:\n(defn some-fn\n   [app-db event]\n   (reaction\n     (let [a-path-element @(subscribe [:get-path-part])]   ;; \nAs you can see, this reaction has two input signals: app-db and (subscribe [:get-path-part]).  If either changes, \nthe reaction will rerun.\nIn some cases, the returned reaction might not even\nuse app-db and, instead, it might only use subscribe to provide input signals. In that case, the \nregistered subscription would belong to \"Level 3\" of the signal graph (discussed in earlier tutorials).\nRemember to deref any use of app-db and subscribe.  It is a rookie mistake to forget. I do it regularly.\nInstead of using reaction (a macro), you can use reagent/make-reaction (a utility function) which gives you the additional \nability to attach an :on-dispose handler to the returned reaction, allowing you to do cleanup work when the subscription is no longer needed. \nSee an example of using :on-dispose here\nExample reg-sub-raw\nThe following use of reg-sub can be found in the todomvc example:\n(reg-sub\n  :visible-todos\n\n  ;; signal function - returns a vector of two input signals\n  (fn [query-v _]     \n    [(subscribe [:todos])\n     (subscribe [:showing])])\n\n  ;; the computation function - 1st arg is a 2-vector of values\n  (fn [[todos showing] _]   \n    (let [filter-fn (case showing\n                      :active (complement :done)\n                      :done   :done\n                      :all    identity)]\n      (filter filter-fn todos))))\n\nwe could rewrite this use of reg-sub using reg-sub-raw like this:\n(reg-sub-raw \n  :visible-todos\n  (fn [app-db event]  ;; app-db not used, name shown for clarity\n    (reaction         ;; wrap the computation in a reaction\n      (let [todos   @(subscribe [:todos])   ;; input signal #1\n            showing @(subscribe [:showing]) ;; input signal #2 \n            filter-fn (case showing\n                        :active (complement :done)\n                        :done   :done\n                        :all    identity)]\n        (filter filter-fn todos))))\n\nA view could do (subscribe [:visible-todos]) and never know which of \nthe two variations above was used. Same result delivered.\n\nPrevious: Correcting a wrong      \nUp:       Index      \nNext:     Basic App Structure       \n\n\n\n"},"Basic-App-Structure.html":{"url":"Basic-App-Structure.html","title":"Basic App Structure","keywords":"","body":"Simpler Apps\nTo build a re-frame app, you:\n\ndesign your app's data structures (data layer)\nwrite Reagent view functions (domino 5)\nwrite event handler functions (control layer and/or state transition layer, domino 2)\nwrite subscription functions (query layer, domino 4)\n\nFor simpler apps, you should put code for each layer into separate files:\nsrc\n├── core.cljs         For a living example of this approach, look at the todomvc example.\nNo really, you should absolutely look at the todomvc example example, as soon as possible.

Register Handlers\nre-frame's various handlers all work in the same way.  You declare \nand register your handlers in the one step, like this \"event handler\" example: \n(re-frame/reg-event-db       ;; event handler will be registered automatically\n  :some-id\n  (fn [db [_ value]]\n    ...  do some state change based on db and value ))\n\nAs a result, there's nothing further you need to do because \nhandler registration happens as a direct result of loading the code \n(presumably via a  tag in your HTML file).\n2. Kick Start Reagent\nCreate a function main which does a reagent/render of your root reagent component main-panel:\n(defn main-panel       ;; my top level reagent component\n  []\n  [:div \"Hello DDATWD\"])\n\n(defn ^:export main     ;; call this to bootstrap your app\n  []\n  (reagent/render [main-panel]\n                  (js/document.getElementById \"app\")))\n\nMounting the top level component main-panel will trigger a cascade of child \ncomponent creation.  The full DOM tree will be rendered.\n3. Loading Initial Data\nLet's rewrite our main-panel component to use a subscription. In effect, \nwe want it to source and render some data held in app-db.  \nFirst, we'll create the subscription handler:\n(re-frame.core/reg-sub     ;; a new subscription handler\n  :name               ;; usage (subscribe [:name])\n  (fn [db _]\n    (:display-name db)))  ;; extracts `:display-name` from app-db\n\nAnd now we use that subscription:\n(defn main-panel \n  []\n  (let [name  (re-frame.core/subscribe [:name])]  ;; \nThe user of our app will see funny things \nif that (subscribe [:name]) doesn't deliver good data. But how do we ensure \"good data\"?\nThat will require: \n\ngetting data into app-db; and\nnot get into trouble if that data isn't yet in app-db.  For example, \nthe data may have to come from a server and there's latency.\n\nNote: app-db initially contains {}\nGetting Data Into app-db\nOnly event handlers can change app-db. Those are the rules!! Indeed, even initial \nvalues must be put in app-db via an event handler. \nHere's an event handler for that purpose:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n  :initialise-db                 ;; usage: (dispatch [:initialise-db])\n  (fn [_ _]                         ;; Ignore both params (db and event)\n     {:display-name \"DDATWD\"     ;; return a new value for app-db\n      :items [1 2 3 4]}))\n\nYou'll notice that this handler does nothing other than to return a map. That map \nwill become the new value within app-db.\nWe'll need to dispatch an :initialise-db event to get it to execute. main seems like the natural place: \n(defn ^:export main\n  []\n  (re-frame.core/dispatch [:initialise-db])   ;;  \nBut remember, event handlers execute async. So although there's \na dispatch within main, the event is simply queued, and the \nhandler for :initialise-db \nwill not be run until sometime after main has finished.\nBut how long after?  And is there a race condition?  The \ncomponent main-panel (which assumes good data) might be \nrendered before the :initialise-db event handler has \nput good data into app-db. \nWe don't want any rendering (of main-panel) until after app-db \nhas been correctly initialised. \nOkay, so that's enough of teasing-out the issues. Let's see a \nquick sketch of the entire pattern. It is very straight-forward.\nThe Pattern\n(re-frame.core/reg-sub   ;; supplied main-panel with data\n  :name                  ;; usage (subscribe [:name])\n  (fn  [db _]\n    (:display-name db)))\n\n(re-frame.core/reg-sub   ;; we can check if there is data\n  :initialised?          ;; usage (subscribe [:initialised?])\n  (fn  [db _]\n    (not (empty? db))))  ;; do we have data\n\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n   :initialise-db\n   (fn [db _]\n       (assoc db :display-name \"Jane Doe\")))\n\n(defn main-panel    ;; the top level of our app \n  []\n  (let [name  (re-frame.core/subscribe [:name])]   ;; we need there to be good data\n    [:div \"Hello \" @name])))\n\n(defn top-panel    ;; this is new\n  []\n  (let [ready?  (re-frame.core/subscribe [:initialised?])]\n    (if-not @ready?         ;; do we have good data?\n      [:div \"Initialising ...\"]   ;; tell them we are working on it\n      [main-panel])))      ;; all good, render this component\n\n(defn ^:export main     ;; call this to bootstrap your app\n  []\n  (re-frame.core/dispatch [:initialise-db])\n  (reagent/render [top-panel]\n                  (js/document.getElementById \"app\")))\n\nScales Up\nThis pattern scales up easily.\nFor example, imagine a more complicated scenario in which your app \nis not fully initialised until 2 backend services supply data.\nYour main might look like this:\n(defn ^:export main     ;; call this to bootstrap your app\n  []\n  (re-frame.core/dispatch [:initialise-db])           ;; basics\n  (re-frame.core/dispatch [:load-from-service-1])     ;; ask for data from service-1\n  (re-frame.core/dispatch [:load-from-service-2])     ;; ask for data from service-2\n  (reagent.core/render [top-panel]\n                  (js/document.getElementById \"app\")))\n\nYour :initialised? test then becomes more like this sketch: \n(re-frame.core/reg-sub\n  :initialised?          ;; usage (subscribe [:initialised?])\n  (fn  [db _]\n    (and  (not (empty? db))\n          (:service1-answered? db)\n          (:service2-answered? db)))))\n\nThis assumes boolean flags are set in app-db when data was loaded from these services.\nCheating - Synchronous Dispatch\nIn simple cases, you can simplify matters by using dispatch-sync (instead of dispatch) in \nthe main function.  \nThis technique can be seen in the TodoMVC Example.\ndispatch queues an event for later processing, but dispatch-sync acts \nlike a function call and handles an event immediately. That's useful for initial data \nload we are considering, particularly for simple apps. Using dispatch-sync guarantees \nthat initial state will be in place before any views are mounted, so we know they'll \nsubscribe to sensible values.  We don't need a guard like top-panel (introduced above). \nBut don't get into the habit of using dispatch-sync everywhere. It is the right \ntool in this context and, sometimes, when writing tests, but \ndispatch is the staple you should use everywhere else.\nLoading Initial Data From Services\nAbove,  in our example main, we imagined using (re-frame/dispatch [:load-from-service-1])  to request data\nfrom a backend services.  How would we write the handler for this event?\nThe next Tutorial will show you how.\n\nPrevious:  Namespaced Keywords      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Talking To Servers  \n\n\n\n"},"Talking-To-Servers.html":{"url":"Talking-To-Servers.html","title":"Talking To Servers","keywords":"","body":"Talking To Servers\nThis page describes how a re-frame app might \"talk\" to a backend HTTP server.\nWe'll assume there's a json-returning server endpoint \nat \"http://json.my-endpoint.com/blah\". We want to GET from that \nendpoint and put a processed version of the returned json into app-db. \nTriggering The Request\nThe user often does something to trigger the process. \nHere's a button which the user could click: \n(defn request-it-button\n  []\n  [:div {:class \"button-class\"\n         :on-click  #(dispatch [:request-it])}  ;; get data from the server !!\n         \"I want it, now!\"])\n\nNotice the on-click handler - it dispatches the event [:request-it].\nThe Event Handler\nThat :request-it event will need to be \"handled\", which means an event handler must be registered for it.\nWe want this handler to:\n\nInitiate the HTTP GET\nUpdate a flag in app-db which will trigger a modal \"Loading ...\" message for the user to see\n\nWe're going to create two versions of this event handler.  First, we'll create a\nproblematic version of the event handler and then, realising our sins, we'll write\na second version which is a soaring paragon of virtue. Both versions \nwill teach us something.\nVersion 1\nWe're going to use the cljs-ajax library as the HTTP workhorse.\nHere's the event handler: \n(ns my.app.events                   ;; \n   (:require [ajax.core :refer [GET]]\n             [re-frame.core :refer [reg-event-db]))\n\n(reg-event-db        ;;  further dispatch !!\n       :error-handler #(dispatch [:bad-response %1])})     ;;  further dispatch !!\n\n     ;; update a flag in `app-db` ... presumably to cause a \"Loading...\" UI \n     (assoc db :loading? true)))    ;;  return an updated db\n\nFurther Notes:\n\nEvent handlers are normally put into an events.cljs namespace\nNotice that the GET callbacks issue a further dispatch. Such callbacks \nshould never attempt to close over db themselves, or make\nany changes to it because, by the time these callbacks happen, the value \nin app-db may have changed.  Whereas, if they dispatch, then the event \nhandlers looking after the event they dispatch will be given the latest copy of the db.\nevent handlers registered using reg-event-db must return a new value for \napp-db.  In our case, we set a flag which will presumably cause a \"Loading ...\"\nUI to show.\n\nSuccessful GET\nAs we noted above, the on-success handler itself is just\n(dispatch [:process-response RESPONSE]).  So we'll need to register a handler\nfor this event too.\nLike this:\n(reg-event-db                   \n  :process-response             \n  (fn\n    [db [_ response]]           ;; destructure the response from the event vector\n    (-> db\n        (assoc :loading? false) ;; take away that \"Loading ...\" UI \n        (assoc :data (js->clj response))))  ;; fairly lame processing\n\nA normal handler would have more complex processing of the response. But we're \njust sketching here, so we've left it easy.\nThere'd also need to be a handler for the :bad-response event too.  Left as an exercise.\nProblems In Paradise?\nThis approach will work, and it is useful to take time to understand why it \nwould work, but it has a problem:  the event handler isn't pure.  \nThat GET is a side effect, and side effecting functions are like a \nwell salted paper cut. We try hard to avoid them.\nVersion 2\nThe better solution is, of course, to use an effectful handler. This \nis explained in detail in the previous tutorials: Effectful Handlers \nand Effects.  \nIn the 2nd version, we use the alternative registration function, reg-event-fx , and we'll use an \n\"Effect Handler\" supplied by this library \nhttps://github.com/Day8/re-frame-http-fx.\nYou may soon feel confident enough to write your own.\nHere's our rewrite:\n(ns my.app.events                  \n   (:require\n      [ajax.core :as ajax]        \n      [day8.re-frame.http-fx]  \n      [re-frame.core :refer [reg-event-fx]))\n\n(reg-event-fx        ;; \nNotes:\n\nOur event handler \"describes\" side effects, it does not \"do\" side effects\nThe event handler we wrote for :process-response stays as it was\n\n\nPrevious:  Loading Initial Data      \nUp:  Index      \nNext:  Subscribing to External Data  \n\n\n\n"},"Subscribing-To-External-Data.html":{"url":"Subscribing-To-External-Data.html","title":"Subscribing to External Data","keywords":"","body":"\n\nTable Of Contents\n\nSubscribing to External Data\nThere Can Be Only One!!\nComponents Don't Know, Don't Care\nA 2nd Source\nVia A Subscription\nThe Subscription Handler's Job\nSome Code\nAny Good?\nWarning: Undo/Redo\nQuery De-duplication\nThanks To\n\n\nThe Alternative Approach\nAbsolutely Never Do This\n\n\nSubscribing to External Data\nIn Talking To Servers we learned how to \ncommunicate with servers using both pure and effectful handlers. \nThis is great, but what if you want to \nquery external data using subscriptions the \nsame way you query data stored in app-db? This tutorial will show you how.\nThere Can Be Only One!!\nre-frame apps have a single source of data called app-db.\nThe re-frame README asks you to imagine app-db as something of an in-memory database. You \nquery it (via subscriptions) and transactionally update it (via event handlers). \nComponents Don't Know, Don't Care\nComponents never know the structure of your app-db, much less its existence. \nInstead, they subscribe, declaratively, to \ndata, like this (subscribe [:something \"blah\"]), and that allows Components to \nobtain a stream of updates to \"something\", while knowing nothing about the source of the data. \nA 2nd Source\nAll good but ... SPAs are seldom completely self contained data-wise. \nThere's a continuum between apps which are 100% standalone data-wise, \nand those where remote data is utterly central to the app's function. \nIn this page, we're exploring the remote-data-centric end of this continuum.\nAnd just to be clear, when I'm talking about remote data, I'm thinking of data \nluxuriating in remote databases like firebase, rethinkdb, PostgreSQL, Datomic, etc \n\ndata sources that an app must query and mutate.\n\nSo, the question is: how would we integrate this kind of remote data into an app when\nre-frame seems to have only one source of data: app-db?How do we introduce a second or even third source of data?  How should we subscribe \nto this remote data, and how would we update it?\nBy way of explanation, let's make the question specific: how could we wire up a \nComponent which displays a collection of items, \nwhen those items come from a remote database? \nIn your mind's eye, imagine this kind of query against that remote database:\n select id, price, description from items where type=\"see through\".\nVia A Subscription\nIn re-frame, Components always obtain data via a subscription. Always.  \nSo, our Component which shows items is going to \n(let [items (re-frame/subscribe [:items \"see through\"]) ...\n\nand the subscription handler will deliver them. \nWhich, in turn, means our code must have a subscription handler defined:\n(re-frame/reg-sub\n  :items\n  (fn [db [_ item-type]\n    ...))\n\nWhich is fine ... except we haven't really solved this problem yet, have we?We've just transferred \nthe problem away from the Component and into the subscription handler? \nWell, yes, we have, and isn't that a fine thing!!  That's precisely what we want \nfrom our \nsubscription handlers ... to manage how the data is sourced ... to hide that from \nthe Component.\nThe Subscription Handler's Job\nRight, so let's write the subscription handler. \nThere'll be code in a minute but, first, let's describe how the subscription handler\nwill work: \n\nUpon being required to provide items, it has to issue \na query to the remote database. Perhaps this will be done via\na RESTful GET. Or via a firebase connection. Or by pushing a JSON \nrepresentation of the query down a websocket. Something. And it is the \nsubscription handler's job to know how it is done.  \n\nThis query be async - with the results arriving sometime \"later\". And when they \neventually arrive, the handler must organise for the query results to be placed into app-db, \nat some known, particular path. In the meantime, the handler might want to ensure that the absence of \nresults is also communicated to the Component, allowing it to display \"Loading ...\".\nThe Nine States of Design \nhas some useful information on designing your application for different states that your data might be in.\n\nThe subscription handler must return something to the Component. It should give back a \nreaction to that known, particular path within app-db, so that when the query results \neventually arrive, they will flow through into the Component for display.\n\nThe subscription handler will detect when the Component is destroyed and no longer requires \nthe subscription. It will then clean up, getting rid of those now-unneeded items, and\nsorting out any stateful database connection issues. \n\n\nNotice what's happening here.  In many respects, app-db is still acting as the single source of data.\nThe subscription handler is organising for the right remote data to \"flow\" into app-db at a known, \nparticular path, when it is needed by a Component. And, equally, for this data to be cleaned up when it \nis no longer required.\nSome Code\nEnough fluffing about with words, here's a code sketch for our subscription handler:\n(re-frame/reg-sub-raw\n  :items\n  (fn [app-db [_ type]]\n       (let  [query-token (issue-items-query!\n                            type\n                            :on-success #(re-frame/dispatch [:write-to  [:some :path]]))]\n         (reagent.ratom/make-reaction\n           (fn [] (get-in @app-db [:some :path] []))\n           :on-dispose #(do (terminate-items-query! query-token)\n                            (re-frame/dispatch [:cleanup [:some :path]]))))))\n\nA few things to notice:\n\nWe are using the low level reg-sub-raw to register our handler (and not the more normal reg-sub)\nso we can get an :on-dispose callback when the subscription is no longer needed.\nSee the reg-sub-raw docs at the end of this tutorial\n\nYou have to write  issue-items-query!.  Are you making a Restful GET? \nAre you writing JSON packets down a websocket?  The query has to be made.\n\nWe do not issue the query via a dispatch because, to me, it isn't an event. But we most certainly \ndo handle the arrival of query results via a dispatch and associated event handler. That to me \nis an external event happening to the system. The event handler can curate the arriving data in \nwhatever way makes sense. Maybe it does nothing more than to assoc into an app-db path, \nor maybe this is a rethinkdb changefeed subscription and your event handler will have to collate \nthe newly arriving data with what has previously been returned. Do what \nneeds to be done in that event handler, so that the right data will be put into the right path.\n\nWe use Reagent's make-reaction function to create a reaction which will return \nthat known, particular path within app-db where the query results are to be placed.\n\nWe use the on-dispose callback on this reaction to do any cleanup work\nwhen the subscription is no longer needed. Clean up app-db?  Clean up the database connection?\n\n\nAny Good?\nIt turns out that this is a surprisingly flexible and clean approach. And pretty damn obvious once \nsomeone points it out to you (which is a good sign).  There's a lot to like about it.\nFor example, if you are using rethinkdb, which supports queries which yield \"change feeds\" over time,\nrather than a one-off query result, you have to actively close such queries when they are no longer needed. \nThat's easy to do in our cleanup code.\nWe can source some data from both PostgreSQL and firebase in the one app, using the same pattern. \nAll remote data access is done in the same way.\nBecause query results are dispatched to an event handler, you have a lot of flexibility \nabout how you process them. \nThe whole set of pieces can be arranged and tweaked in many ways.  For example, \nwith a bit of work, we could keep a register of all currently used queries.\nAnd then, if ever we noticed that the app had gone offline, \nand then back online, we could organise to reissue all the queries  again \n(with results flowing back into \nthe same known paths), avoiding stale results.\nAlso, notice that putting ALL interesting data into app-db has nice \nflow on effects. In particular, it means it is available to event handlers, \nshould they need it when servicing events (event handlers get db as a parameter, right?).If this item data was held in a separate place, other than app-db, \nit wouldn't be available in this useful way.  \nWarning: Undo/Redo\nThis technique caches remote data in app-db.  Be sure to exclude this \ncache area from any undo/redo operations \nusing the available configuration options\nQuery De-duplication\nIn v0.8.0 of re-frame onwards, subscriptions are automatically de-duplicated. \nIn prior versions, in cases where the same query is simultaneously issued \nfrom multiple places, you'd want to \nde-duplicate the queries. One possibility is to do this duplication \nin issue-items-query! itself. You can\ncount the duplicate queries and only clear the data when that count goes to 0. \nThanks To\n@nidu for his valuable review comments and insights\nThe Alternative Approach\nEvent handlers do most of the heavy lifting within re-frame apps.\nWhen buttons get clicked, or items get dragged 'n dropped, or tabs get\nchosen, they know how to transition the app from one state \nto the next. That's their job. And, when they make such\na transition, it is quite reasonable to expect them to ALSO \nsource the data needed in the new state. \nSo there's definitely a case for NOT using the approach outlined \nabove and, instead, making event handlers source data and \nplonk it into a certain part of app-db for use by subscriptions. \nIn effect, there's definitely an argument that \nsubscriptions should only ever source from app-db BUT that it is \nevent handlers which start and stop the sourcing of data from \nremote places.  \nSorry, but you'll have to work out which of these two variations\nworks best for you. \nWithin this document the first alternative has been given more word count \nonly because there's a few more tricks to make it work, not because it \nis necessarily preferred. \nAbsolutely Never Do This\nSometimes, because of their background with other JS frameworks, \nnew re-framians feel like the Components themselves (the views) \nshould have the responsibility of sourcing the data they need. \nThey then use React lifecycle methods like :component-did-mount \nto load remote data. \nI believe this is absolutely the wrong way to do it. \nIn re-frame, we want views to be as simple and dumb as possible. They turn \ndata into HTML and nothing more. they absolutely do not do imperative stuff.\nUse one of the two alternatives described above.\n\nPrevious:  Talking to Servers      \nUp:  Index      \n"},"Debugging-Event-Handlers.html":{"url":"Debugging-Event-Handlers.html","title":"Debugging Event Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Debugging Event Handlers\nThis page describes techniques for debugging re-frame's event handlers.\nEvent handlers are quite central to a re-frame app.  Only event handlers \ncan update app-db to \"step\" an application \"forward\" from one state\nto the next.\nThe debug Interceptor\nYou might wonder: is my event handler making the right changes to app-db?  \nDuring development, the built-in re-frame.core/debug interceptor can help. \nIt writes to console.log:\n\nthe event being processed, for example:   [:attempt-world-record true]\nthe changes made to db by the handler in processing the event\n\ndebug uses clojure.data/diff to compare the value of app-db \nbefore and after the handler ran, showing what changed. \nclojure.data/diff returns a triple \n, the first two entries of which \ndebug will display in console.log (the 3rd says what has not changed and isn't interesting).\nThe output produced by clojure.data/diff can take some getting used to, \nbut you should stick with it -- your effort will be rewarded.\nUsing debug\nSo, you will add this Interceptor like this:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n   :some-id\n   [re-frame.core/debug]         ;;  \nExcept, of course, we need to be more deft - we only want \ndebug in development builds. We don't \nwant the overhead of those clojure.data/diff calculations in production.\nSo, this is better: \n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n   :some-id\n   [(when ^boolean goog.DEBUG re-frame.core/debug)]   ;;  \ngoog.DEBUG is a compile time constant provided by the Google Closure Compiler. \nIt will be true when the build within project.clj is :optimization :none and false\notherwise.\nHa! I see a problem, you say.  In production, that when is going to \nleave a nil in the interceptor vector. So the Interceptor vector will be [nil].\nSurely that's a problem?  \nWell, actually, no it isn't. re-frame filters out any nil from interceptor vectors. \nToo Much Repetition - Part 1\nEach event handler has its own interceptor stack. \nThat might be all very flexible, but does that mean we have to put this debug \nbusiness on every single handler?  That would be very repetitive. \nYes, you will have to put it on each handler.  And, yes, that could be repetitive,  unless \nyou take some steps.\nOne thing you can do is to define standard interceptors at the top of the event.cljs namespace:\n(def standard-interceptors  [(when ^boolean goog.DEBUG debug)  another-interceptor])\n\nAnd then, for any one event handler, the code would look like:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n   :some-id\n   standard-interceptors        ;; \nor perhaps:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n   :some-id\n   [standard-interceptors specific-interceptor]  ;; mix with something specific\n   some-handler-fn)\n\nSo that specific-interceptor could be something required for just this one\nevent handler, and it can be combined the standard ones.\nWait on! \"I see a problem\", you say.  standard-interceptors is a vector, and it\nis within another vector along side specific-interceptor - so that's\nnested vectors of interceptors!  \nNo problem, re-frame uses flatten to take out all the nesting - the \nresult is a simple chain of interceptors. And, as we have discussed,\nnils are removed.\n3. Checking DB Integrity\nAlways have a detailed schema for the data in app-db!\nWhy?\nFirst, schemas serve as invaluable documentation. When I come to \na new app, the first thing I want to look at is the underlying \ninformation model - the schema of the data.  I hope it is well \ncommented and I expect it to be rigorous and complete, using \nClojure spec\nor, perhaps, a Prismatic Schema.\nSecond a good spec allows you to assert the integrity and correctness of \nthe data in app-db.  Because all the data is in one place, that means you \nare asserting the integrity of ALL the data in your app, at one time. All of it.\nWhen should we do this?  Ideally, every time a change is made!\nWell, it turns out that only event handlers can change the value in\napp-db, so only an event handler could corrupt it. So, we'd like to\nrecheck the integrity of app-db immediately\nafter every event handler has run.\nAll of it, every time. This allows us to catch any errors very early, \neasily assigning blame (to the rouge event handler).\nSchemas are typically put into db.cljs (see the todomvc example in the re-frame repo). Here's \nan example using Prismatic Schema\n(although a more modern choice would be to use Clojure spec):\n(ns my.namespace.db\n  (:require\n    [schema.core :as s]))\n\n;; As exactly as possible, describe the correct shape of app-db \n;; Add a lot of helpful comments. This will be an important resource\n;; for someone looking at you code for the first time.\n(def schema           \n  {:a {:b s/Str\n       :c s/Int}\n   :d [{:e s/Keyword\n        :f [s/Num]}]})\n\nAnd a function which will check a db value against that schema:\n(defn valid-schema?\n  \"validate the given db, writing any problems to console.error\"\n  [db]\n  (let [res (s/check schema db)]\n    (if (some? res)\n      (.error js/console (str \"schema problem: \" res)))))\n\nNow, let's organise for valid-schema? to be run after every handler. \nWe'll use the built-in  after Interceptor factory function:\n(def standard-interceptors [(when ^boolean goog.DEBUG debug)\n                           (when ^boolean goog.DEBUG (after db/valid-schema?))]) ;; \nNow, the instant a handler messes up the structure of app-db you'll be alerted.\nBut this overhead won't be there in production.\nToo Much Repetition - Part 2\nAbove, we discussed a way of \"factoring out\" common interceptors into standard-interceptors. \nThere's an additional technique we can use to ensure that all event handlers get certain Interceptors: \nyou write a custom registration function -- a replacement for reg-event-db -- like this:\n(defn my-reg-event-db          ;; alternative to reg-event-db\n  ([id handler-fn]\n    (re-frame.core/reg-event-db id standard-interceptors handler-fn))\n  ([id interceptors handler-fn]\n    (re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n        id\n        [standard-interceptors interceptors]\n        handler-fn)))\n\nNotice how this registration function inserts our standard interceptors every time.\nFrom now on, you can register your event handlers like this and know that the two standard Interceptors have been inserted:\n(my-reg-event-db      ;; \nWhat about the -fx variation?\nAbove we created my-reg-event-db as a new registration function for -db handlers.\nNow, -db handlers take db and event arguments, and return a new db.\nSo, they MUST return a new db value.   \nBut what if we tried to do the same for -fx handlers which, instead, return \nan effects map which may, or may not, contain a :db?  Our solution would \nhave to allow for the absence of a new db value (by doing no validity check, because nothing \nwas being changed). \n(def debug? ^boolean goog.DEBUG)\n(def standard-interceptors-fx\n  [(when debug?  debug)    ;; as before\n   (when debug? (after #(if % (db/valid-schema? %)))]) ;; \nand then:\n(defn my-reg-event-fx          ;; alternative to reg-event-db\n  ([id handler-fn]\n    (re-frame.core/reg-event-fx id standard-interceptors-fx handler-fn))\n  ([id interceptors handler-fn]\n    (re-frame.core/reg-event-fx\n        id\n        [standard-interceptors-fx interceptors]\n        handler-fn)))\n\n\n\n\n"},"Debugging.html":{"url":"Debugging.html","title":"Debugging","keywords":"","body":"Debugging\nThis page describes a technique for \ndebugging re-frame apps.

Every single one.  A delightfully \nregular environment to understand and debug!\nObserve The Beast\nBret Victor has explained to us the importance of observability.\nIn which case, when we are debugging re-frame, what do we want to observe?\nre-frame's domino process involves data values flowing in \nand out of relatively simple, pure functions.  Derived data flowing. \nSo, to debug we want to observe:\n\nwhich functions are called\nwhat data flowed in and out of them\n\nFunctions and data:  What data was in the event?  What event handler \nwas then called?  What interceptors then ran? What state changes did \nthat event handler cause?  What subscription handlers were then \ntriggered?  What new values did they then return? And which Reagent \ncomponents then rerendered? What hiccup did they return?  It's all \njust functions processing data.\nSo, in Clojurescript, how do we observe functions and data?  Well, \nas luck would have it, ClojureScript is a lisp and it is readily traceable.  \nHow To Trace?\nBelow, I suggest a particular combination of technologies which, working together,\nwill write a trace to the devtools console. Sorry, but there's no fancy \nSVG dashboard.  We said simple, right?\nFirst, use clairvoyant to trace function calls and data flow. We've had \na couple of Clairvoyant PRs accepted, and they make it work well for us.\nWe've also written a specific Clairvoyant tracer tuned for our re-frame \nneeds. https://clojars.org/day8/re-frame-tracer. \nSecond, use cljs-devtools because it allows you to inspect traced data. \nThat means you'll need to be using a very fresh version of Chrome. \nBut it is worth it.\nFinally, because we want you to easily scan, parse and drill into trace \ndata, we'll be using Chrome devtool's console.group() and console.endGroup().\nYour browser\nYou'll need to install clj-devtools by following these instructions.\nYour Project\nAdd these to your project.clj :dependencies. First up a private fork of clairvoyant.\n\nThen the customised tracer for cljs-devtools that includes a colour choice\n\nNext, we're going to assume that you have structured you app in the recommended way,\nmeaning you have the namespaces events.cljs, subs.cljs and views.cljs.\nIt is the functions within these namespaces that we wish to trace.  \n\nAt the top of each add these namespaces, add these requires:\n [clairvoyant.core :refer-macros [trace-forms]]\n [re-frame-tracer.core :refer [tracer]]\n\n\nThen, immediately after the ns form add (if you want a green colour):\n(trace-forms {:tracer (tracer :color \"green\")}\n\n\nFinally, put in a closing ) at the end of the file. Now all functions within the \nns will be traced.  It that is too noisy -- perhaps you won't want to trace all the helper functions --\nthen you can move the wrapping macros trace-froms\naround to suit your needs.\n\nColour choice\nWe have sauntered in the direction of the following colours\n|    file      | colour|\n|--------------|-------|\n|handlers.clj| green |\n|subs.cljs   | brown |\n|views.clj   | gold  |\nBut I still think orange, flared pants are a good look.  So, yeah.  You may end up choosing others. \n\n\nSay No To Anonymous\nTo get good quality tracing, you need to provide names for all \nyour functions.  So, don't let handlers be anonymous when registering them. \nFor example, make sure you name the renderer in a Form2 component:\n(defn my-view\n  []\n  (let [name   (subscribe [:name])]\n    (fn my-view-renderer []                ;;   \nAnd name those event handlers:\n(reg-event-db\n  :blah\n  [interceptors]\n  (fn blah-handler    ;;   \nIMPORTANT\nBy default, our clairvoyant fork does not produce any trace!! \nYou must throw a compile-time switch for tracing to be included into development builds. \nIf you are using lein, do this in your project.clj file:\n:cljsbuild {:builds [{:id \"dev\"            ;; for the development build, turn on tracing\n                      ....\n                      :compiler {\n                          :closure-defines {\"clairvoyant.core.devmode\" true}\n                      }}]}\n\nSo, just to be clear, if you see no tracing when you are debugging, it \nis almost certainly because you haven't successfully turned on this switch. \nYour production builds need to nothing because, by default, all trace \nis compiled out of the code. \nThe result\nLoad your app, and open the dev-tools console.  Make an event happen (click a button?). \nNotice the colour coded tracing showing the functions being called and the derived data flowing. \nDo you see the dominos?\nWarning\nIf the functions you are tracing take large data-structures as parameters, or \nreturn large values, then you will be asking clairvoyant to push/log a LOT \nof data into the js/console. This can take a while and might mean devtools \ntakes a lot of RAM.  \nFor example, if your app-db was big and complicated, you might use path \nmiddleware to \"narrow\" that part of app-db passed into your event handler \nbecause logging all of app-db to js/console might take a while (and not \nbe that useful).\nReact Native\nIf you have not enabled Remote JS Debugging in the emulator you will \nget the following error related to console.groupCollapsed:\n[TypeError: console.groupCollapsed is not a function.

And, so, our setup would have to construct both values.\nBut how to create a useful db value?  \ndb is a map of a certain structure, so one way would be to simply assoc values \ninto a map at certain paths to simulate a real-world db value or, even easier, just use \na map literal, like this:\n;; a test\n(let [\n      ;; setup - create db and event\n      db      {:some 42  :thing \"hello\"}   ; a literal\n      event   [:select-triange :other :event :args]\n\n      ;; execute\n      result-db (select-triange db event)] \n\n      ;; validate that result-db is correct)\n      (is ...)\n\nThis certainly works in theory, but in practice, \nunless we are careful, constructing the db \nvalue in setup could:\n\nbe manual and time consuming \ntie tests to the internal structure of app-db\n\nThe setup of every test could end up relying on the internal structure\nof app-db and any change in that structure (which is inevitable over time) \nwould result in a lot re-work in the tests. That's too fragile.\nSo, this approach doesn't quite work. \nEvent Handlers - Setup - Part 2\n\nIn re-frame, Events are central. They are the \"language of the system\". They \nprovide the eloquence.  \n\nThe db value (stored in app-db) is the cumulative result\nof many event handlers running.\nWe can use this idea.  In setup, instead of manually trying to create that db value, we could \n\"build up\" a db value by threading db through many event handlers\nwhich cumulatively create the required initial state.  Tests then need\nknow nothing about the internal structure of that db.\nLike this:\n(let [\n      ;; setup - cummulatively build up db \n      db (-> {}    ;; empty db \n             (initialise-db [:initialise-db])   ;; each event handler expects db and event \n             (clear-panel   [:clear-panel])\n             (draw-triangle [:draw-triangle 1 2 3]))\n\n      event  [:select-triange :other :stuff]\n\n      ;; now execute the event handler under test\n      db'    (select-triange db event)]\n\n      ;; validate that db' is correct\n      (is ...)\n\nThis approach works so long as all the event handlers are\nof the -db kind, but the threading gets a little messy when some event \nhandlers are of the -fx kind which take a coeffect argument and \nreturn effects, instead of a db value. \nSo, this approach is quite workable in some cases, but can get messy\nin the general case. \nEvent Handlers - Setup - Part 3\nThere is further variation which is quite general but not as pure.\nDuring test setup we could literally just dispatch the events \nwhich would put app-db into the right state.  \nExcept, we'd have to use dispatch-sysnc rather dispatch to \nforce immediate handling of events, rather than queuing.  \n  ;; setup - cummulatively build up db \n  (dispatch-sync [:initialise-db])\n  (dispatch-sync [:clear-panel])\n  (dispatch-sync [:draw-triangle 1 2 3]))\n\n  ;; execute\n  (dispatch-sync  [:select-triange :other :stuff])\n\n  ;; validate that the valuein `app-db` is correct\n  ;; perhaps with subscriptions\n\nNotes:\n\nwe use dispatch-sync because dispatch is async (event is handled not now, but soon) \nNot pure. We are choosing to mutate the global app-db. But\nhaving said that, there's something about this approach with is remarkably \npragmatic.\nthe setup is now very natural. The associated handlers can be either -db or -fx\nif the handlers have effects other than just updating app-db, we might need to stub out XXX\nHow do we look at the results ???? \n\nIf this method appeals to you, you should ABSOLUTELY review the utilities in this helper library:\nre-frame-test.\nIn summary, event handlers should be easy to test because they are pure functions. The interesting\npart is the unittest \"setup\" where we need to establishing an initial value for db. \nSubscription Handlers\nHere's a Subscription Handler from \nthe todomvc example:\n(reg-sub\n  :visible-todos\n\n  ;; signal function\n  (fn [query-v _]\n    [(subscribe [:todos])\n     (subscribe [:showing])])\n\n  ;; computation function\n  (fn [[todos showing] _]   ;; that 1st parameter is a 2-vector of values\n    (let [filter-fn (case showing\n                      :active (complement :done)\n                      :done   :done\n                      :all    identity)]\n      (filter filter-fn todos))))\n\nHow do we test this?\nFirst, we could split the computation function from its registration, like this: \n(defn visible-todos\n  [[todos showing] _]  \n\n  (let [filter-fn (case showing\n                    :active (complement :done)\n                    :done   :done\n                    :all    identity)]\n   (filter filter-fn todos)))\n\n(reg-sub\n  :visible-todos\n  (fn [query-v _]\n      [(subscribe [:todos])\n       (subscribe [:showing])])\n  visible-todos)     ;; \nThat makes visible-todos available for direct unit testing.  But, as we experienced \nwith Event Handlers, the challenge is around constructing db values (first parameter)\nin a way which doesn't become fragile. \nView Functions - Part 1\nComponents/views are more tricky and there are a few options.\nBut remember my ugly secret - I don't tend to write tests for my views. \nBut here's how, theoretically, I'd write tests if I wasn't me ...\nIf a View Function is Form-1,\nthen it is fairly easy to test.  \nA trivial example:\n(defn greet\n   [name]\n   [:div \"Hello \" name])\n\n(greet \"Wiki\")\n;;=> [:div \"Hello \" \"Wiki\"]\n\nSo, here, testing involves passing values into the function and checking the data structure returned\nfor correctness. \nWhat's returned is hiccup, of course. So how do you test hiccup for correctness?  \nhiccup is just a clojure data structure - vectors containing keywords, and maps, and other vectors, etc.\nPerhaps you'd use https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter to declaratively check on the presence\nof certain values and structures? Or do it more manually.\nView Functions - Part 2A\nBut what if the View Function has a subscription?  \n(defn my-view\n   [something] \n   (let [val  (subscribe [:query-id])]     \nThe use of subscribe makes the function impure (it obtains data from places other than its args).\nA testing plan might be: \n\nsetup  app-db with some values in the right places  (via dispatch of events?)\ncall my-view (with a parameter) which will return hiccup\ncheck the hiccup structure for correctness. \n\nContinuing on, in a second phase you could then:\n\nchange the value in app-db  (which will cause the subscription to fire)\ncall view functions again (hiccup returned). \ncheck the new hiccup for correctness \n\nWhich is all possible, if a little messy. \nView Functions - Part 2B\nThere is a pragmatic method available to handle the impurity: use with-redefs \nto stub out subscribe.  Like this:\n(defn subscription-stub [x]\n  (atom\n    (case x\n      [:query-id] 42)))\n\n(deftest some-test\n  (with-redefs [re-frame/subscribe (subscription-stub)]\n    (testing \"some some view which does a subscribe\"\n      ..... call the view function and the hiccup output)))\n\nFor more integration level testing, you can use with-mounted-component\nfrom the reagent-template \nto render the component in the browser and validate the generated DOM. \nView Functions - Part 2C\nOr ... there is another option: you can structure in the first place for pure view functions. \nThe trick here is to create an outer and inner component.  The outer sources the data \n(via a subscription), and passes it onto the inner as props (parameters).\nAs a result, the inner component, which does the testable work, is pure and \neasily tested. The outer is impure but trivial.\nTo get a more concrete idea, I'll direct you to another page in the re-frame docs \nwhich has nothing to do with testing, but it does use this simple-outer-subscribe-with-complicated-inner-render \npattern for a different purpose: \nUsing Stateful JS Components\nNote: this technique could be made simple and almost invisible via the \nuse of macros.\nThis pattern has been independently discovered by many. For example, here \nit is called the Container/Component pattern.\nSummary\nEvent handlers will be your primary focus when testing. Remember to review the utilities in\nre-frame-test.\n\n\n\n"},"FAQs/":{"url":"FAQs/","title":"FAQs","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I Inspect app-db?\nHow long after I do a dispatch does the event get handled?\nHow can I use a subscription in an Event Handler\nHow do I use logging method X\nDispatched Events Are Null\nWhy is re-frame implemented in .cljc files\nWhy do we need to clear the subscription cache when reloading with Figwheel?\nHow can I detect exceptions in Event Handlers?\nHow do I store normalised data in app-db?\nHow do I register a global interceptor\nHow do I turn on/off polling a database every 60 secs\n\nWant To Add An FAQ?\nWe'd like that.

Performance Problems","keywords":"","body":"Eek! Performance Problems\n\n\nTable Of Contents\n\n1. Is It The debug Interceptor?\n2. = On Big Structures\nAn Example Of Problem 2\nSolutions To Problem 2\n\n\n3. Are you Using a React key?\n4. Callback Functions\nA Weapon\n\n\n1. Is It The debug Interceptor?\nThis first one is something of a non-problem. \nAre you are using the re-frame.core/debug Interceptor?\nYou should be, it's useful. But you do need to be aware of its possible performance implications.  \ndebug reports what's changed after an event handler has run by using \nclojure.data/diff to do deep, CPU intensive diff on app-db. \nThat diff could be taking a while, and leading to apparent performance problems.\nThe good news is this really isn't a production problem.  debug should only be \npresent in an Interceptor Chain at development time, and it should be removed \nfrom production using this technique.\nAlso related, anything which writes large data structures, or strings, to the \njs console, will be slow. So press F12, pull up devtools console, and have a \ngood look at what's happening in there. \n2. = On Big Structures\nReagent uses = to compare the previous value of a prop with the \nnew value of that prop, when it determines if a component needs \nrerendering. Make sure you have a good understanding of this.. \nIn the worst case, if those props are big data structures which differ only in some \ntiny, leaf aspect, then a lot of CPU cycles will be spent doing \nthe = comparison only to eventually work out that, indeed, the \nanswer is false. \nThis problem is exacerbated when components return a lot of hiccup, because \nlots of hiccup normally means lots of props which, in turn, means lots of = \nwork to do on each of those props. Any rerender with those characteristics \ncould end up chewing a lot of CPU cycles.\nAn Example Of Problem 2\nImagine you were rendering a 19 by 19 \"Go\" board. \nAnd imagine that you have a high level board renderer component \nwhich creates hiccup for the 361 sub components (19 x 19 grid), \nand that it provides 3 props  to each child:\n\ngrid x cord\ngrid y coord\na chunk of data representing the current game state, from which each \nof the 361 individual grid components is expected to extract the data \nthey need to render their grid position. \n\nThis arrangement could be slow. \nFirst, you have a parent component returning hiccup for 361 sub-components\nand that's a lot of hiccup!! Sure, it might not be much code - just a couple \nof nested for, but the hiccup data structure built will be substantial.\nSecond, after the board renderer returns all this hiccup, for every \none of those 361 sub-components, Reagent must then check the 3 props to \nsee if they are = to the value last rendered (to determine if they, in turn, \nneed to be rerendered), and the comparison on the 3rd prop (game state) \nmight be deep and expensive. Worse, we do the same expensive check 361 \ntimes in a row, and every time we get a false (because games state \nis not = to last time). \nThird, because Reagent gets 361 falses, it will further rerender \nall 361 sub-components even though 360 of them produce the same \nhiccup as last time - only one position in the gird has changed. \nSo, when a new stone is placed on the board, and the game state changes, \nthat triggers a large amount of unnecessary calculation, just to figure \nout that there's only a rendering change at one point in the 19x19 grid. \nSo, that's how you can get a performance problem:  lots of hiccup, \nmixed with time consuming = tests on big props. \nSolutions To Problem 2\nThe solution is to not do the unnecessary work.  Duh!  \nProduce only the hiccup that is needed.  Don't unnecessarily \npass around big complicated state in props, unless you really need to. \nIn the Go example described above, for each new stone placed, only \none point in the Go board actually needs to be rerendered, and \nyet our code asked Reagent to chew a lot of CPU to figure that out.\nThese kinds of tweaks would improve performance: \n\ndon't give the entire game state to each of the 361 sub components \nand then ask them to extract what they need.  Instead, give each \njust the state it needs, and nothing more. That will make the = \nprocess faster. It will also allow for Reagent to figure out that \n360 of the sub components have the same props as last time, and \ndon't need rerendering. And, so, only one sub-component will be \nrerendered when the parent \"board level\" component rerenders.\n\nAlso, could you render the board row by row? So that less hiccup \nis produced by any one component?  Can those rows subscribe \nto just the data for their row, so they only rerender when the \nrow-data changes; they only generate hiccup when something really has changed?\n\n\n3. Are you Using a React key?\nCorrectly using React keys can also make a huge difference to performance.\nSome resources:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/27863039/key-property-inside-component-function\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/37186230/5215391\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/reagent-project/J1ELaLV20MU/iutebA-JEgAJ\n\n4. Callback Functions\nLook at this div:\n[:div  {:on-mouse-over  (fn [event] ....)  }   \"hello\"]\nEvery time it is rendered, that :on-mouse-over function will be regenerated, \nand it will NOT test = to the last time it rendered.  It will appear to be a new function. \nIt will appear to React that it has to replace the event handler. \nMost of the time, this is not an issue.  But if you are generating a LOT of DOM\nthis small inefficiency can add up.  \nTo work around the problem, lift the function out of the render.  Use a Form-2 function like this:\n(defn my-component \n   []\n   (let [mouse-over-cb  (fn [event] ....)  ]      ;; created once \n      (fn []                                      ;; rendered many times\n         [:div {:on-mouse-over  mouse-over-cb}]))\nNow, React will see that mouse-over-cb is the same as last time. It won't think \nthe event handler has been replaced. \nBut like I say, don't be too paranoid about this, it is unlikely\nto be an issue unless you have something like a table with a \nlot of rows. \nA Weapon\nOf course, the way to really track down what is going on is to \nuse the OFFICIAL debugging technique. \nSee the four dominoes play out in the console. You may be surprised \nby what you find is happening. \nBe aware that tracing adds its own performance drag - there's the \noverhead of all that stuff getting written on the js console. \nEspecially if the data getting traced is big - for example, \ntracing all of app-db in the console can take a while and force \nChrome devtools to take masses of RAM.  So you may want to selectively \nadd tracing when poking about. \n"},"Solve-the-CPU-hog-problem.html":{"url":"Solve-the-CPU-hog-problem.html","title":"Solve the CPU hog problem","keywords":"","body":"Solving The CPU Hog Problem\nSometimes a handler has a lot of CPU intensive work to do, and \ngetting through it will take a while. \nWhen a handler hogs the CPU, nothing else can happen. Browsers \nonly give us one thread of execution and that CPU-hogging handler \nowns it, and it isn't giving it up. The UI will be frozen and \nthere will be no processing of any other handlers (eg: on-success \nof POSTs), etc, etc. Nothing.\nAnd a frozen UI is a problem.  GUI repaints are not happening. And \nuser interactions are not being processed.\nHow are we to show progress updates like \"Hey, X% completed\"?  Or \nhow can we handle the user clicking on that \"Cancel\" button trying \nto stop this long running process?\nWe need a means by which long running handlers can hand control\nback for \"other\" processing every so often, while still continuing \non with their computation.\nThe re-frame Solution\nFirst, all long running, CPU-hogging processes are put in event handlers.\nNot in subscriptions.  Not in components. Not hard to do,\nbut worth establishing as a rule, right up front. \nSecond, you must be able to break up that CPU \nwork into chunks. You need a way to do part of the work, pause, \nthen resume from where you left off (more in a minute).\nIn a perfect world, each chunk would take something like\n16ms (60 fps). If you go longer, say 50ms or 100ms, it is no train \nsmash, but UI responsiveness will degrade and animations, like \nbusy spinners,  will get jerky. Shorter is better, but less than \n16ms delivers no added smoothness. \nThird, within our handler, after it completes one unit (chunk)\nof work, it should not continue straight on with the next.  Instead, \nit should do a dispatch to itself and, in the event vector, \ninclude something like the following: \n\na flag to say the work is not finished\nthe working state so far; and \nwhat chunk to do next. \n\nA Sketch\nHere's an -fx handler which counts up to some number in chunks:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-fx \n  :count-to\n  (fn \n    [{db :db} [_ first-time so-far finish-at]]\n    (if first-time\n      ;; We are at the beginning, so:\n      ;;     - modify db, causing popup of Modal saying \"Working ...\"\n      ;;     - begin iterative dispatch. Give initial version of \"so-far\"\n      {:dispatch [:count-to false {:counter 0} finish-at]  ;; dispatch to self\n       :db (assoc db :we-are-working true)}\n      (if (> (:counter so-far) finish-at)\n        ;; We are finished:\n        ;;  - take away the state which causes the modal to be up\n        ;;  - store the result of the calculation\n        {:db (-> db\n                 (assoc :fruits-of-labour (:counter so-far)) ;; remember the result\n                 (assoc :we-are-working false))}             ;; no more modal\n        ;; Still more work to do\n        ;;   - run the calculation\n        ;;   - redispatch, passing in new running state\n        (let [new-so-far   (update so-far :counter inc)]\n          {:dispatch [:count-to false new-so-far finish-at]}))))\n\nWhy Does A Redispatch Work?\nA dispatched event is handled asynchronously. It is queued\nand not actioned straight away. \nAnd here's the key: After handling current events, re-frame yields control\nto the browser, allowing it to render any pending DOM changes, etc. After \nit is finished, the browser will hand control back to the re-frame router \nloop, which will then handle any other queued events \nwhich, in our case, would include the event we just dispatched to perform \nthe next chunk of work. \nWhen the next dispatch is handled, a next chunk of work will be done, and then another\ndispatch will happen. And so on. dispatch after dispatch. Chunk \nafter chunk. In 16ms increments if we are very careful (or some small amount \nof time less than, say, 100ms). But with the browser getting a look-in after each iteration.\nVariations\nAs we go, the handler could be updating some value in app-db which indicates \nprogress, and this state would then be rendered into the UI.\nAt a certain point, when all the work is done, the handler will likely put the\nfruits of its computational labour into app-db and clear any flags which might, for example,\ncause a modal dialog to be showing progress.  And the process would then be done.\nCancel Button\nIt is a flexible pattern.  For example, it can be tweaked to handle a \"Cancel' button ...\nIf there was a “Cancel” button to be clicked, we might \n(dispatch [:cancel-it]) and then have this event’s handler tweak the app-db\nby adding :abandonment-required flags. When a chunk-processing-handler\nnext begins, it could check for this :abandonment-required flag, and,\nif found, stop the CPU intensive process (and clear the abandonment flags).When the abandonment-flags\nare set, the UI could show \"Abandoning process ...\" and thus appear responsive \nto the user's click on “Cancel”.\nThat's just one approach. You can adapt the pattern as necessary. \nFurther Notes\nGoing to this trouble is completely unnecessary if the long running \ntask involves I/O (GET, POST, HTML5 database action?) because the \nbrowser will handle I/O in another thread and give UI activities plenty of look in. \nYou only need to go to this trouble if it is your code which is \nhogging the CPU.  \nForcing A One Off Render\nImagine you have a process which takes, say, 5 seconds, and chunking \nis just too much effort.\nYou lazily decide to leave the UI unresponsive for that short period.Except, \nyou aren't totally lazy.  If there was a button which kicked off \nthis 5 second process, and the user clicks it, you’d like the UI to \nshow a response. Perhaps it could show  a modal popup thing saying \n“Doing X for you”. \nAt this point, you still have a small problem to solve. You want \nthe UI to show your modal message before you then hog the CPU for \n5 seconds.\nUpdating the UI means altering app-db.  Remember, the UI is a \nfunction of the data in app-db. Only changes to app-db cause UI \nchanges. \nSo, to show that Modal, you’ll need to assoc some value into app-db \nand have that new value change what is rendered in your reagent components.\nYou might be tempted to do this: \n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n  :process-x\n  (fn\n   [db event-v]\n   (assoc db :processing-X  true)    ;; hog the CPU\n   (do-long-process-x)))    ;; update state, so reagent components render a modal\n\nBut that is just plain wrong. \nThat assoc into db is not returned (and it must be for a -db handler).And, even if that did somehow work, \nthen you continue hogging the thread with do-long-process-x.  There's no \nchance for any UI updates because the handler never gives up control. This \nhandler owns the thread right through.\nAhhh, you think.  I know what to do!  I'll use that pattern I read \nabout in the Wiki, and re-dispatch within an-fx handler: \n(re-frame.core/reg-event-fx\n  :process-x\n  (fn \n    [{db :db} event-v]\n    {:dispatch  [:do-work-process-x]   ;; do processing later, give CPU back to browser.     \n     :db (assoc  db  :processing-X true)})) ;; ao the modal gets rendered\n\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-db\n  :do-work-process-x\n  (fn [db _]\n    (do-long-process-x db)))   ;; return a new db, presumably containing work done\n\nSo close.  But it still won’t work. There's a little wrinkle.\nThat event handler for :process-x will indeed give back control \nto the browser. BUT, because of the way reagent works, that assoc on db \nwon't trigger DOM updates until the next animation frame runs, which is 16ms away.  \nSo, you will be yielding control to the browser, but for next 16ms \nthere won't appear to be anything to do.  And, by then, your CPU hogging \ncode will have got control back, and will keep control for the next 5 \nseconds. That nice little Dialog telling you the button was clicked and \naction is being taken won't show.\nIn these kinds of cases, where you are only going to give the UI \none chance to update (not a repeated chances every few milli seconds), \nthen you had better be sure the DOM is fully synced. \nTo do this, you put meta data on the event being dispatched:\n(re-frame.core/reg-event-fx\n  :process-x\n  (fn \n    [{db :db} event-v]\n    {:dispatch  ^:flush-dom [:do-work-process-x]   ;; \nNotice the ^:flush-dom metadata on the event being dispatched.  Use \nthat when you want the UI to be fully updated before the event dispatch \nis handled. \nYou only need this technique when you: \n\nwant the DOM to be fully updated\nbecause you are going to hog the CPU for a while and not give it back. One chunk of work.\n\nIf you handle via multiple chunks you don't have to do this, because \nyou are repeatedly handing back control to the browser/UI.  Its just \nwhen you are going to tie up the CPU for a one, longish chunk. \n\n\n\n"},"Using-Stateful-JS-Components.html":{"url":"Using-Stateful-JS-Components.html","title":"Using Stateful JS Components","keywords":"","body":"Using Stateful JS Components\nYou know what's good for you, and you know what's right.  But it\ndoesn't matter - the wickedness of the temptation is too much. \nThe JS world is brimming with shiny component baubles: D3, \nGoogle Maps, Chosen, etc.  \nBut they are salaciously stateful and mutative.  And, you, \nraised in a pure, functional home, with caring, immutable parents, \nknow they are wrong.  But, my, how you still yearn for the sweet \nthrill of that forbidden fruit. \nI won't tell, if you don't.  But careful plans must be made  ... \nThe overall plan\nTo use a stateful js component, you'll need to write two Reagent components:\n\nan outer component responsible for sourcing data via a subscription or r/atom or cursor, etc.  \nan inner component responsible for wrapping and manipulating the stateful JS component via lifecycle functions.  \n\nThe pattern involves the outer component, which sources data, supplying this data to the inner component via props. \nExample Using Google Maps\n(defn gmap-inner []\n  (let [gmap    (atom nil)\n        options (clj->js {\"zoom\" 9})\n        update  (fn [comp]\n                  (let [{:keys [latitude longitude]} (reagent/props comp)\n                        latlng (js/google.maps.LatLng. latitude longitude)]\n                    (.setPosition (:marker @gmap) latlng)\n                    (.panTo (:map @gmap) latlng)))]\n\n    (reagent/create-class\n      {:reagent-render (fn []\n                         [:div\n                          [:h4 \"Map\"]\n                          [:div#map-canvas {:style {:height \"400px\"}}]])\n\n       :component-did-mount (fn [comp]\n                              (let [canvas  (.getElementById js/document \"map-canvas\")\n                                    gm      (js/google.maps.Map. canvas options)\n                                    marker  (js/google.maps.Marker. (clj->js {:map gm :title \"Drone\"}))]\n                                (reset! gmap {:map gm :marker marker}))\n                              (update comp))\n\n       :component-did-update update\n       :display-name \"gmap-inner\"})))\n\n\n\n(defn gmap-outer []\n  (let [pos (subscribe [:current-position])]   ;; obtain the data\n    (fn []\n      [gmap-inner @pos])))\n\nNotes:\n\ngmap-outer obtains data via a subscription. It is quite simple - trivial almost.\nit then passes this data as a prop  to gmap-inner.  This inner component has the job of wrapping/managing the stateful js component (Gmap in our case above)\nwhen the data (delivered by the subscription) to the outer layer changes, the inner layer, gmap-inner, will be given a new prop - @pos in the case above.\nwhen the inner component is given new props, its entire set of lifecycle functions will be engaged. \nthe renderer for the inner layer ALWAYS renders the same, minimal container hiccup for the component.  Even though the props have changed, the same hiccup is output. So it will appear to React as if nothing changes from one render to the next. No work to be done. React/Reagent will leave the DOM untouched. \nbut this inner component has other lifecycle functions and this is where the real work is done.  \nfor example, after the renderer is called (which ignores its props), component-did-update will be called. In this function, we don't ignore the props, and we use them to update/mutate the stateful JS component.  \nthe props passed (in this case @pos) in must be a map, otherwise (reagent/props comp) will return nil.\n\nPattern Discovery\nThis pattern has been independently discovered by many. To my knowledge, \nthis description of the Container/Component pattern\nis the first time it was written up.\nCode Credit\nThe example gmaps code above was developed by @jhchabran in this gist:\nhttps://gist.github.com/jhchabran/e09883c3bc1b703a224d#file-2_google_map-cljs\nD3 Examples\nD3 (from @zachcp): \n\nBlog Post: http://zachcp.org/blog/2015/reagent-d3/\nCode: https://github.com/zachcp/simplecomponent\nExample: http://zachcp.github.io/simplecomponent/\n\nA different take on using D3: \nhttps://gadfly361.github.io/gadfly-blog/2016-10-22-d3-in-reagent.html\nAdvanced Lifecycle Methods\nIf you mess around with lifecycle methods, you'll probably want to read Martin's explanations:\nhttps://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/props-children-and-component-lifecycle-in-reagent.html\n\n\n\n"},"The-re-frame-logo.html":{"url":"The-re-frame-logo.html","title":"The re-frame Logo","keywords":"","body":"The re-frame Logo\n\nWho\nCreated by the mysterious, deep thinker, known only as @martinklepsch.\nSome say he appears on high value stamps in Germany and that he once \npunched a horse to the ground.
